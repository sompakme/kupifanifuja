As someone who took part in football, basketball, and gymnastics as a child, he was always going to play this sport because of his family history. Whilst his junior days are a mystery to us, we do know that this Polish man entered his very first main draw at the French Open in 2018 and won his match against Tennys Sandgren. Hubi, who can be a lot better, is a good-natured man, and it can’t be certainly known if that quality interferes with his pursuit of greatness in the sport. Otherwise, his overall win percentage would be a lot higher than what it is now. This youngster has shown consistency in his results, and his best-ever performance in a Grand Slam was at Wimbledon in 2021, when he reached the semis. He defeated his idol, Federer, en route to the semis. Will he achieve what he’s truly capable of, or will this Pole buckle under pressure?</p><h2 id=hubert-hurkacz-girlfriend class=rb-heading-index-1><h2><strong>Hubert Hurkacz Girlfriend<br></strong></h2></h2><p>This Polish tennis player is a private person when it comes to relationships. Most Poles are, and from what we’ve learnt about this man, we understand that he has never been in a relationship in the past. Hubi has never revealed what he does in private, and we’re certain that he won’t in the future too.</p><h3 id=who-is-hubert-hurkacz-currently-dating class=rb-heading-index-2><strong>Who is Hubert Hurkacz currently dating?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wtfoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/mateshur.jpg><p>This player is currently single and isn’t dating anyone. He has never been married either and doesn’t have any kids that we know of.</p><h2 id=family-parents-siblings-amp-children class=rb-heading-index-3><strong>Family: Parents, Siblings & Children</strong></h2><p>Our player’s parents are Zofia Maliszewska-Hurkacz and Krzysztof Hurkacz. They met as swimming teammates at the Wroclaw University of Economics. Nika, his younger sister, is 10 years his junior and also a tennis player. Hubi was born into a family of athletes. His mother was a Polish junior tennis champion, and one of his uncles, Tomasz Maliszewski, was a professional tennis player. This player’s granddad was an international volleyball player as well. His mother introduced him to the sport, and his earliest teachers were his mother and father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wtfoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/hursib.jpg><h2 id=hubert-hurkacz-total-prize-money-amp-net-worth class=rb-heading-index-4><strong>Hubert Hurkacz Total Prize Money & Net Worth</strong></h2><p>This Pole’s career win record is just under 55%. As of writing, the former world number 9 has four titles to his name. Having won over $6.3 million in prize money from playing tennis, we estimate this gentleman’s net worth to be about $5 million now.</p><p><span class=relatedpost1>RELATED:<a class=relatedpost2 href=#>Top 20 Hottest And Cutest Tennis Wives and Girlfriends (Pics & Stories)</a></span></p><h3 id=how-much-does-hubert-hurkacz-earn-per-year class=rb-heading-index-5><strong>How much does Hubert Hurkacz earn per year?</strong></h3><p>Hubi’s principal brand sponsor is the sportswear business Yonex.
