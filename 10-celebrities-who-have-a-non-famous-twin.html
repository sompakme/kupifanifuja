Most A-listers have a non-identical twin though, and sometimes, they barely resemble one another.</p><h2 id=eva-green><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Eva Green</span></h2><p>Eva Green is most famous as the Bond girl from <i>Casino Royale</i> (2006), but she has since appeared in several movies and TV shows, such as <i>Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children</i> (2016) <i>and Penny Dreadful.</i></p><p>The 40 year-old French actress has a non-identical twin sister, named Joy Green. According to <a href=#>Hello Magazine</a>, she lives in Italy and runs a wine company together with her husband. Eva even joked that she is the other, happier version of herself.</p><h2 id=kiefer-sutherland><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Kiefer Sutherland</span></h2><p>Both Kiefer and his twin sister Rachel work in the entertainment industry. She works as a post-production film supervisor. Among her most recent projects are Nurses (2020) and Mary Kills People (2017).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Sutherland twins were born in London, but they later moved to Canada as both of their parents are actually Canadian. They both have <a href=#>a dual citizenship</a>.</p><h2 id=ashton-kutcher><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ashton Kutcher</span></h2><p>Born in the Midwest, Ashton Kutcher started out as a model and only later moved to Hollywood and <a href=#>built his acting career</a>. His twin brother Michael is mostly known for being related to Ashton, but he is also a businessman and a public speaker.</p><p>He advocates for people with cerebral palsy, the permanent <span class=ILfuVd><span class=hgKElc>movement disorder</span></span> he was diagnosed with at the age of three. When he was thirteen years old, he almost died from cardiac arrest. He was lucky, though: he had a successful heart transplant.</p><h2 id=scarlett-johansson><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Scarlett Johansson</span></h2><p>Scarlett Johansson has a twin brother, named Hunter. When she's wearing makeup, the resemblance is not as obvious as on the pictures where she <a href=#>went makeup-free</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hunter has a heart of gold. He founded Solar Responders, a charity that responds to natural disasters. When Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, the organization provided solar panels to help the country get back on its feet.</p><h2 id=rami-malek><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Rami Malek</span></h2><p>The Bohemian Rhapsody star has an identical twin brother whose name rhymes with his: they are Rami and Sami Malek. They also have an older sister Yasmine and she is a doctor.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="15 Behind-The-Scenes Facts About 'Mr. Robot'" href=#>15 Behind-The-Scenes Facts About 'Mr. Robot'</a></span></p><p>They were born to Egyptian Coptic Orthodox immigrants. Sami lives in LA and works as a teacher. When the twins were younger, it was really hard to tell them apart. Rami once took a test as Sami and nobody noticed.</p><h2 id=giovanni-ribisi><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Giovanni Ribisi</span></h2><p>Giovanni and Marissa Ribisi are both well-known in their circles, but Giovanni is still the one twin that will more likely ring a bell. On television, he portrayed Frank Buffay, Jr.&nbsp; in <a href=#>Friends</a>, and Jeff Billings in The Wonder Years. His filmography is also impressive; he appeared in Avatar (2009), Ted (2012), and Selma (2014).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His twin sister Marissa also appeared in a number of TV shows in all kinds of minor roles. In 2007, she launched her own fashion line Whitley Kros.</p><h2 id=jon-heder><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jon Heder</span></h2><p>Jon Heder is most famous for his role in <a href=#>Napoleon Dynamite</a> (2004) and Blades of Glory (2007). He grew up in a big family. Besides his identical twin Dan, Heder has four siblings.</p><p>It seems that entertainment runs in both of their veins. Dan is a visual effects artist who worked on a lot of hit movies, such as Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Captain America: Civil War (2016), and Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019).</p><h2 id=gisele-bundchen><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Gisele Bundchen</span></h2><p>It's not just <a href=#>yoga that's keeping Gisele Bundchen forever young</a>, it's also good genes. The Brazilian model has five sisters, one of which is her fraternal twin. Just like Gisele, her twin sister Patricia and sister Gabriela also gave modeling a shot. Gisele was the only who who got signed by Elite Model Management, though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="Tom Brady & Gisele Bündchen: 10 Things To Know About Their Relationship" href=#>Tom Brady & Gisele Bündchen: 10 Things To Know About Their Relationship</a></span></p><p>The supermodel didn't leave her twin behind; <a href=#>Patricia worked as her manager and spokesperson</a>.</p><h2 id=vin-diesel><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Vin Diesel</span></h2><p><a href=#>Vin Diesel has an adorable family</a>. He is a father of three and is married to Paloma Jimenez, a Mexican model. He is good at keeping <a href=#>his personal life</a> private. After all, most fans don't even know what's his real name.</p><p>The Fast and Furious star was born as Mark Sinclair in California and he grew up in New York City. His twin brother is a film editor and he doesn't really look much like Diesel. His name is Paul Vincent.</p><h2 id=parker-posey><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Parker Posey</span></h2><p>The 52-year old Parker Posey is most famous for her work with Christopher Guest, appearing in many of his mockumentaries, such as <i>For Your Consideration</i> (2006) and <i>Mascots</i> (2016). She's also appeared in a number of indie movies in the '90s, such as <i>The Daytrippers</i> (1996) and The House of Yes (1997).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Parker has a twin brother, named Christopher who is a lawyer.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a class=bc-title-link title="10 Little Known Facts About Jay-Z's Family" href=#>10 Little Known Facts About Jay-Z's Family</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmavmKR6qa3VnmSaZZ6ku26ywKamrqtdqcSquo4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-have-a-non-famous-twin.html&text=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Have%20A%20Non-Famous%20Twin&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-celebrities-who-have-a-non-famous-twin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-have-a-non-famous-twin.html&title=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Have%20A%20Non-Famous%20Twin" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-have-a-non-famous-twin.html&title=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Have%20A%20Non-Famous%20Twin" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-have-a-non-famous-twin.html&title=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Have%20A%20Non-Famous%20Twin" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-have-a-non-famous-twin.html&description=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Have%20A%20Non-Famous%20Twin" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10-celebs-who-stole-iconic-props-from-their-movies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Celebs Who Stole Iconic Props From Their Movies">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10-actors-from-the-last-decade-that-we-love-and-10-we-ve-had-enough-of.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Actors From The Last Decade That We Love (And 10 We've Had Enough Of)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
