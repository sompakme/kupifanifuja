Similarly, Love Island USA has been a major hit for CBS since fans want to know <a href=#>which couples have made it</a> and about <a href=#>the strict rules cast members must follow</a>.</p><p>Because of how popular both shows are, fans were excited when Carly Lawrence And Bennett Sipes became a couple and got married. However, it was later revealed that Sipes and Lawrence were getting a divorce. That revealation made fans talk about how each of their reality show pasts foreshadowed their divorce.</p><p>This article will reveal how <strong>Lawrence and Sipes' past reality TV relationships indicated they would get divorced</strong>.

Ultimately, two of the most noteworthy people from those two show's second seasons have been Carly Lawrence and Bennett Sipes.</p><p>During the second season of Too Hot to Handle, Carly Lawrence gained lots of fans who became interested in her love life. Before that, Bennett Sipes starred in the second season of Love Island USA where his tenure left fans feeling frustrated.</p><p>Sadly for Sipes and Lawrence, the fate of their <strong>past separate reality TV relationships seemed to be echoed in the news they were getting divorced</strong>.</p><p>In January 2022, Screen Rant published an article about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how Carly Lawrence's ex felt about her being involved with Bennett Sipes</a>. That article also examined the sad truths about Sipes and Lawrence's past reality TV relationships.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Lawrence's case, Screen Rant's article detailed two relevant things about what is known about her romantic reality TV history.

On top of that, Too Hot to Handle fans also saw that <strong>Lawrence was quick to move on from a failed relationship</strong>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sarah-hyland.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Sarah Hyland's Fans Question Whether She's Had Plastic Surgery Amid The Announcement Of Her 'Love Island' Exit">Sarah Hyland's Fans Question Whether She's Had Plastic Surgery Amid The Announcement Of Her 'Love Island' Exit</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Sarah Hyland won't return to 'Love Island USA,' but fans appear more interested in her changing appearance.</p><p>During the second season of Too Hot to Handle, the show's viewers <strong>saw Lawrence get involed with Chase De Moor</strong>. Even though Lawrence and De Moor both were undeniably gorgeous together, their relationship soon faltered and they quickly put an end to it.</p><p>After their split, De Moor went on to get involved with Tabitha Clifft. Similarly, Lawrence didn't wait long to find someone new to get close to, as <strong>she went on to link up with Joey Joy</strong>.</p><p>As Screen Rant's article revealed, Chase De Moor was rooting for Carly Lawrence to find happiness after their split. When Lawrence revealed on Instagram that she was dating Bennett Sipes, De Moor commented on her post with fire and heart-eye emojis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/too-hot-to-handle-s-carly-lawrence-and-chase-de-moor-before-their-breakup.jpg><p>Unfortunately for Lawrence, things only got worse for her from there. After Lawrence got involved with Joy, <strong>they broke up amid a lot of drama</strong> that he created.</p><p>As Too Hot to Handle fans will no doubt remember, there were headlines about <strong>Lawrence and Joy breaking up after he cheated on her</strong>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/brenden-durell-3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Netflix's 'Too Hot To Handle' Coach Brenden Durell Shares Tips For Getting Intimate With Life In An Exclusive Interview">Netflix's 'Too Hot To Handle' Coach Brenden Durell Shares Tips For Getting Intimate With Life In An Exclusive Interview</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>We sat down with the athlete-turned-intimacy-coach to hear how he got started in the space - plus, he shares his tips for fostering connection.</p><p>As the same Screen Rant article also revealed, Love Island USA fans got to see Bennett Sipes have a lot of chemistry with a woman. During that show's second season, Sipes was invovled with a woman named Lakeyn Call.</p><p>While watching Love Island USA, many <strong>fans felt Sipes and Call had a lot of chemistry</strong>. As a result, viewers were notably frustrated when Sipes and Call were voted off the show far quicker than most fans wanted them to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/love-island-usa-s-bennett-sipes-and-lakeyn-call-before-their-split.jpg><p>Looking back at the fate of Lawrence and Sipes reality TV relationships, <strong>their divorce seems to be an echo of their pasts</strong>.</p><p>While it is important to note there is no indication that Sipes ever cheated on Lawrence, both of her breakups foreshadow their divorce. After all, <strong>Lawrence was unlucky in love on both occasions</strong>. Hopefully the fact that <strong>Lawrence quickly moved in the past</strong> means she will bounce back after her divorce.</p><p>When it comes to Sipes and Call, the fact that fans were disappointed by them being eliminated quickly is similar to his divorce.
