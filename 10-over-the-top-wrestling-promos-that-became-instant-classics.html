Let's take a look back at some of the more uproarious promos in wrestling that became instant classics.</p><h2 id=brian-pillman-pillman-39-s-got-a-gun><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Brian Pillman: Pillman's Got A Gun!</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/brian-pillman-with-a-gun.jpg><p>There were several moments/promos involving <a href=#>Brian Pillman</a> that could have made the cut. His contract signing with WWE is worth going out of your way to see, as well as his brief appearance in ECW. It was his outside the ring confrontation with Steve Austin in late 1996 though, that is still talked about to this day. Brian actually said little in comparison to his typical verbosity, but what he did say was enough to force WWE to apologize the following week. As Steve stalked the outside of Pillman's home, Pillman would say "what's going to happen when Austin 3:16 meets Pillman's 9-millimeter?!" It was one of WWE' most controversial moments and it fittingly featured one of its most controversial stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ric-flair-bloody-promo><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Ric Flair: Bloody Promo</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ric-flair-crimson-mask-cropped.jpg><p>Jerry Lawler said it best, when during a promo on Raw in 2005, he would say, "The Nature Boy is in rare form, tonight!" It was during Ric's feud with Triple H, when he would remind us of his trademark intensity and raw emotion/passion for pro wrestling. He was already sporting a large bandage from a previous cut, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and would expose the gash by ripping off the bandage</a>. He would almost instantly don the crimson mask, and continue cutting the promo. This one has to be seen believed, but be forewarned, viewer discretion is advised.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-rock-toronto><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Rock: Toronto</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Hollywood-Rock.jpg><p>While the "Hollywood" version of The Rock's character was short-lived, it was the last time we will likely ever see him play the role of a heel in WWE. A lot of fans remember <a href=#>this version of The Rock</a>, as it supplied us was some absolutely riotous moments. Chief among these occasions was when The Rock would address the Toronto crowd, eventually confronting them for booing him at WrestleMania 18 the previous year. The Rock would mock the crowd for squealing in delight at the mention of their city. But it was when he insulted their beloved Maple Leafs, that Toronto roared back at The Rock with sheer fury. It was on this night when The Rock reminded us why he is one of the all-time greats.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vince-mcmahon-life-sucks-and-then-you-die><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Vince McMahon: Life Sucks And Then You Die!</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Vince-McMahon-On-Monday-Night-Raw-Cropped.jpg><p>It was during an episode of SmackDown in 2000, when Vince McMahon would unexpectedly erupt into one of the most audacious promos of his life, which is saying something. Flanked by the McMahon-Helmsley regime, Vince would mock the crowd for being offended by the treatment of Chris Jericho, stressing how "unfair" some considered it to be. He then proceeded to essentially taunt the crowd, explaining how they had no self-esteem and would never have a life like his. He would punctuate his tirade with the emphatic decree, "life sucks and then you die!!"</p><h2 id=shawn-michaels-montreal><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Shawn Michaels: Montreal</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/custom-dimensions-1400x700-px-158.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Shawn Michaels was set to appear on Raw in Montreal in 2005, you just knew it was going to be a memorable night. Obviously, the crowd still hated Michaels' guts due to the Montreal Screwjob back at Survivor Series 1997. Therefore, WWE anticipated this and sent him out to cut an in-ring promo that would send the crowd into an absolute frenzy.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>5 Times Shawn Michaels Was A Complete Jerk On-Screen ( & 5 Times He Was One In Real Life)</a></span></p><p>Heading into his SummerSlam main event with Hulk Hogan, Shawn would dupe the crowd into believing that The Hulkster was heading to the ring, by having his music played. But it was nothing more than a ruse. However, the real affront came when Shawn would trick the crowd into believing that Bret was in the building, by having his music play, only to once again be trolling them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-jericho-the-man-of-1-004-holds><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Chris Jericho: The Man Of 1,004 Holds</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Chris-Jericho-Man-Of-1004-Holds-Cropped.jpg><p>It took some time for <a href=#>Chris Jericho to show his full range as a performer in WCW,</a> but when he did so a star was instantly born. It was during his feud with Dean Malenko that Jericho would get his big break. Dean had christened himself the "Man of 1000 Holds," so as to one up him, Jericho claimed he knew 1,004 holds. He would read from a ridiculously long list on Monday Nitro, cutting into a commercial break, only for the broadcast to resume and have Jericho still rambling off his moves. This was the world's introduction to a man who has proven to be on an elite level as a performer.</p><h2 id=mick-foley-3-faces-of-foley-promo><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Mick Foley: 3 Faces Of Foley Promo</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cactus-jack-debut-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was a moment that many, including the performer himself, never thought they would see. But in 1997, Cactus Jack would appear on Monday Night Raw for the first time ever. It was the segment that preceded the debut, although that would prove to be arguably even more memorable. Mick Foley would now be portraying three different characters, and through the power of editing, all three of those characters would appear on-screen together simultaneously. It was relatively brief, but seeing Dude Love, Mankind, and Cactus Jack all interacting with one another, is a sight that never ceases to amaze.</p><h2 id=ric-flair-strips><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ric Flair: Strips</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ric-flair-and-asya.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During an episode of Nitro in 1998, <a href=#>Ric Flair would address Eric Bischoff in an in-ring promo</a>. Ric would revisit his past by going into a frenzy, and pointing out the cost of his various accoutrements. He would then begin to strip off his clothes and challenge Bischoff. He would say that if he'd defeat Eric, he would be allowed to run WCW for 90 days. It was vintage Flair in many ways, but never had he gone quite this far. You have to see this one to believe it, as it's one of the most outrageous moments in a lengthy career.</p><h2 id=randy-savage-cream-of-the-crop><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Randy Savage: Cream Of The Crop</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/randy-savage-cream-of-the-crop-cropped.jpg><p>Only "Macho Man" Randy Savage could take a single serving of coffee creamer, and turn it into a wrestling promo. This is quite possibly the most memorable promo of Savage's career, exemplifying why he was a performer like no other. Randy would declare himself the "cream of the crop," putting several on notice in WWE.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>5 Best Years Of Randy Savage's Wrestling Career (& 5 Worst Years)</a></span></p><p>This promo went less than 3 minutes, but accomplishes just as much as a 15-minute promo could have.

This is one of the most talked about promos in modern history, and it's as entertaining as it is, um, educational!? Scott would generously and thoroughly break down Samoa Joe's and Kurt Angle's less than stellar odds of beating him in an upcoming triangle match. At times, Steiner is factually correct in his summation, but at others he seems a bit off with his math. This one is as head-scratching as it is unforgettable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmefq7KzedOhnGasn6V6sb7OpqasZZOhrrS%2FyJyqZq%2BimsC1uMinnmg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-over-the-top-wrestling-promos-that-became-instant-classics.html&text=10%20Over-The-Top%20Wrestling%20Promos%20That%20Became%20Instant%20Classics&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-over-the-top-wrestling-promos-that-became-instant-classics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-over-the-top-wrestling-promos-that-became-instant-classics.html&title=10%20Over-The-Top%20Wrestling%20Promos%20That%20Became%20Instant%20Classics" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-over-the-top-wrestling-promos-that-became-instant-classics.html&title=10%20Over-The-Top%20Wrestling%20Promos%20That%20Became%20Instant%20Classics" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-over-the-top-wrestling-promos-that-became-instant-classics.html&title=10%20Over-The-Top%20Wrestling%20Promos%20That%20Became%20Instant%20Classics" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-over-the-top-wrestling-promos-that-became-instant-classics.html&description=10%20Over-The-Top%20Wrestling%20Promos%20That%20Became%20Instant%20Classics" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./are-komodo-dragons-descendants-of-dragons.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Are komodo dragons descendants of dragons">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./wallo-gifts-gille-da-kid-slingshot-motorcycle-for-b-day.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wallo Gifts Gille Da Kid Slingshot Motorcycle For B-Day">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
