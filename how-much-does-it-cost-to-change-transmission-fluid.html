Fluid Exchange: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>When it comes to maintaining your vehicle’s transmission, understanding the difference between a transmission flush and a fluid exchange is crucial. While both services aim to improve the performance and longevity of your transmission, they differ in their approach and effectiveness.</p><p>A transmission flush involves using a professional-grade flush machine to completely remove all the automatic transmission fluid (ATF) from the transmission. The flush machine helps flush away grime, dirt, and contaminants that may have accumulated over time. This process is more thorough and removes a higher percentage of the total ATF volume, typically around 90% to 100%. By eliminating the old fluid, a flush can help maintain proper lubrication and cooling, reducing the risk of transmission damage and costly repairs down the line.</p><p>A fluid exchange, on the other hand, is a simpler procedure that relies on gravity to remove the ATF from the transmission pan. It usually drains only about 20% to 40% of the total fluid volume. While a fluid exchange can help remove some contaminants, it may not be as effective in eliminating build-up from the torque converter or cooler lines.</p><p>While a transmission flush provides a more thorough cleaning, it is important to note that not all vehicles require a flush. Some manufacturers recommend only fluid exchanges while others specify flushes. Consulting the vehicle’s owner’s manual is key in determining the appropriate service for your specific make and model.</p><p>A transmission flush removes a higher percentage of old fluid and contaminants compared to a fluid exchange, but it may not be necessary for every vehicle. Always follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for optimal transmission maintenance.</p><h3>Transmission Flush Cost</h3><p>The cost of a transmission flush can vary depending on several factors, including the location, service center chosen, and the make and model of your vehicle.
