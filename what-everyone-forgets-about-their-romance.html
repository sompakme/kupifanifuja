She will also&nbsp;soon be the ex-wife of former NFL player, Jay Cutler. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She shares three kids with Jay</a>. While juggling the roles of a wife and mom, Kristin wrote a New York Best Seller and two cookbooks. Kristin also owns and runs a jewelry company by the name Uncommon James while sparing time to design shoes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Long before Kristin starred in the reality show, Very Cavallari, which broadcasts her life with her family, she had appeared in two other reality TV series, Laguna Beach and its spin-off, The Hills. People associate Kristin with Brody during her time on The Hills where she supposedly dated him. However and as we are about to see, not everything that appears on reality TV is real.</p><p>Kristin and Brody had an on and off TV relationship that lasted less than a year. Although some fans were rooting for the couple to end up together, Kristin and Brody’s romance fizzled when she left town during The Hills finale. Here are other details about their relationship.</p><h2 id=kristin-dated-brody-prior-to-appearing-with-him-on-tv><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>Kristin Dated Brody Prior To Appearing With Him On TV</strong></span></h2><p>Kristin met Brody through one of her co-stars in Laguna Beach. Talan Torriero is the one who introduced Brody to Kristin. The two started dating after the show ended and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their relationship lasted for almost a year</a>. The ex-couple ended their on-again-off-again relationship in 2006 right about the time Kristin was 18 years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kristin-and-brody-s-tv-relationship-was-fake><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><strong>Kristin And Brody’s TV Relationship Was Fake</strong></span></h2><p>The only time when Kristin and Brody were together as a real-life couple was the time they dated after Laguna Beach. The two met again while filming The Hills. They were requested by the producers of the show to pretend that they were dating one another. Their relationship lasted a few episodes.</p><h2 id=kristin-was-prepared-to-fake-it><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><strong>Kristin Was Prepared To Fake It</strong></span></h2><p>Kristin is no longer being silent about her time on her first reality TV shows. She says that a lot of what was shown on the two reality TVs mentioned above was manipulated to fit a narrative the producers wanted to tell. Kristin was unsure about how to handle herself on Laguna Beach but when Kristin was cast on The Hills, she was prepared to say and do whatever her producers wanted her to do.</p><h2 id=kristin-lied-about-her-relationship-with-brody><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>Kristin Lied About Her Relationship With Brody</strong></span></h2><p>Not only did Kristin pretend to be dating Brody in The Hills but she also led viewers to believe that this was the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first mature relationship she had been in</a> and it would have been believable were it true. Prior to dating and fake dating Brody, the only other serious relationship she had ever been in was with her high school boyfriend Stephen Colletti.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Stunning Pics Of Jay Cutler's Wife, Kristin Cavallari</a></span></p><h2 id=kristin-and-brody-s-tv-relationship-was-never-solid><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Kristin And Brody’s TV Relationship Was Never Solid</strong></span></h2><p>You would think that after going through all the trouble of making viewers believe that Kristin and Brody were dating, The Hills producers would at least allow them to have a solid relationship. This was not the case, instead, Kristin and Brody kept having these near misses. Kristin was even linked to other people in the show.</p><h2 id=kristin-was-involved-with-another-co-star><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>Kristin Was Involved With Another Co-Star</strong></span></h2><p>Brody was not the only love interest for Kristin on The Hills. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristin was also involved with Justin Bobby </a>who was Audrina Patridge’s on-again-off-again boyfriend. Kristin also tried to hook up with a bartender to make Brody jealous which backfired on her. Brody started to date another woman and this did not help the relationship in any way.</p><h2 id=brody-was-in-a-relationship-with-a-model-while-supposedly-dating-kristin><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Brody Was In A Relationship With A Model While Supposedly Dating Kristin</strong></span></h2><p>Brody and Kristin did eventually date for a few episodes but since we know that their romance was not real, we wonder who their real partners at the time were if at all, they had any. They both did, Brody was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in a relationship with a Playboy model</a> by the name Jayde Nicole.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristin Cavallari Canoodled With The Cameraman While On 'The Hills'</a></span></p><h2 id=kristin-dated-one-of-the-cameramen-when-she-was-meant-to-be-with-brody><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Kristin Dated One Of The Cameramen When She Was Meant To Be With Brody</strong></span></h2><p>Kristin, on the other hand, was involved with one of the cameramen filming the reality show. While Brody pretended that she had broken up with Nicole, Kristin was in a relationship with Miguel Medina but she had to keep this a secret otherwise it would blow her cover as Brody’s girlfriend. The two were busted by paparazzi a week before the filming of the show was to be completed.</p><h2 id=kristin-got-into-a-staged-fight-with-brody-s-real-girlfriend><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Kristin Got Into A Staged Fight With Brody’s Real Girlfriend</strong></span></h2><p>Part of the ruse of getting viewers to believe that Kristin was in a relationship with Brody was to stage a fight between Nicole and Kristin to make it look like the two women were fighting over Brody. The squabble played out after Nicole saw Brody and Kristin at a club together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-ex-couple-was-just-not-meant-to-be><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>The Ex-Couple Was Just Not Meant To Be</strong></span></h2><p>Kristin and Brody’s romance did not work out the time they dated in real life and the time they fake dated on TV. The two were just not meant to be. Kristin has been married to her soon to be ex-husband for a decade. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brody, on the other hand, married Kaitlynn Carter</a> but the two split after a year of marriage.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look: Kristin Cavallari And Jay Cutler's Divorce</a></span></p><h2 id=kristin-and-brody-kept-in-touch><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Kristin And Brody Kept In Touch</strong></span></h2><p>Although things never worked out between Kristin and Brody, the ex-couple consider themselves friends. In one of the episodes in her recent show, Kristin is filmed catching up with her former co-stars. She reveals to them that she has been keeping in touch with Brody, the two talk but not regularly.</p><h2 id=brody-did-not-invite-kristin-to-his-wedding><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Brody Did Not Invite Kristin To His Wedding</strong></span></h2><p>Kristin was hoping to get an invite to Brody’s wedding especially after speaking to Brody a month prior to the event. When she did not get an invitation, she decided that she would also not send a gift to the couple. The June wedding took place on an island in Indonesia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-are-no-hard-feelings-between-them-and-she-approves-of-kaitlynn><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>There Are No Hard Feelings Between Them, And She Approves Of Kaitlynn</strong></span></h2><p>There are no hard feelings between Kristin and Brody. Kristin may have been briefly upset for missing an invitation to Brody’s wedding but she is happy for Brody and his new wife. She approves of Kaitlynn and further goes on to confirm that Jenner’s mother, Linda Thompson also approves of the union.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Her Marriage Is A Mess But Kristin Cavallari Keeps Herself Healthy</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bustle.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cheatsheet.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">popsugar.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiiq6GjqbavecKarZqknJa%2FqnnBq6adsV2fsq%2B6xKtkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-everyone-forgets-about-their-romance.html&text=What%20Everyone%20Forgets%20About%20Their%20Romance&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-everyone-forgets-about-their-romance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-everyone-forgets-about-their-romance.html&title=What%20Everyone%20Forgets%20About%20Their%20Romance" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-everyone-forgets-about-their-romance.html&title=What%20Everyone%20Forgets%20About%20Their%20Romance" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-everyone-forgets-about-their-romance.html&title=What%20Everyone%20Forgets%20About%20Their%20Romance" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-everyone-forgets-about-their-romance.html&description=What%20Everyone%20Forgets%20About%20Their%20Romance" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-movie-studios-are-reportedly-angry-with-taylor-swift-over-her-upcoming-eras-tour-concert-film.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Movie Studios Are Reportedly Angry With Taylor Swift Over Her Upcoming Eras Tour Concert Film">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-one-film-keanu-reeves-did-not-want-to-make-but-was-forced-to-shoot.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The One Film Keanu Reeves Did Not Want To Make But Was Forced To Shoot">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
