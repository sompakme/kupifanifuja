Living in the limelight for so many years means that every aspect of Cole's life interests fans, specifically his dating history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And there have been a few fascinating pairings with very famous women. But what is it like to be in a relationship with the "Riverdale" actor? Is he quirky and smart? Or is he a little bit of a Casanova? Who better to ask than his current and former girlfriends?</p><h2 id=who-has-cole-sprouse-dated>Who Has Cole Sprouse Dated?</h2><p>There are enough women in Cole Sprouse's dating history to make a rather long list, but what is interesting is not all of them have spoken out about their time together. And many of the pairings happened when he was still a preteen or a young teenager, so they would have been relatively uneventful.</p><p>We know he <a href=#>dated Victoria Justice, who appeared on an episode of his show, The Suite Life of Zack and Cody</a>. When they briefly dated, they were 11, and Justice revealed Sprouse was her first kiss.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between The Olsen Twins And Dylan And Cole Sprouse?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following his pairing with Justice, he dated actress Alyson Stoner, who said he was "the first boy" she had a crush on and dated. The actor dumped her (via Us Weekly), telling her straight: "It's not going to work out."</p><p>Stone also spoke about Sprouse's former girlfriend, Victoria Justice, in a podcast (via Us Weekly). "He and Victoria Justice had a thing before me, and so I was always, like, super nervous, jealous — not jealous, [but] insecure more so," she told "The Night Time Show" in 2017. "She's a babe, like, what am I gonna do? What do I have to offer? I play sports — I don't know."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lili-reinhart-and-cole-sprouse-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other reported girlfriends (who we know less about) include actress Sophie Oda, Reiña Silva, and student Bree Morgan. And then, arguably, his most famous coupling happened when he dated <a href=#>his Riverdale co-star Lili Reinhart</a>. Their relationship was rumored for months before they finally confirmed they were dating (but fans suspected much earlier because of their undeniable onscreen chemistry). They were together for roughly three years and would break up for good in 2020.</p><p>Cole Sprouse was also briefly linked to Kaia Gerber in 2020 and faced backlash for allegedly cheating on Reinhart. He was unimpressed with the accusations and took to Instagram to refute them. And most recently, he has been dating model Ari Fournier since 2021.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Lili Reinhart Encourage Her New Boyfriend Jack Martin To Troll Cole Sprouse's Notorious Call Her Daddy Interview?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Again, Sprouse is exceptionally private, and so is Fournier, but he has shared a sweet message about how she makes him feel. In a 2023 interview with the Call Her Daddy podcast, he said: "The current relationship I am in has woken me up to what real compatibility and trust look like in a way that I've never had before."</p><h2 id=what-have-cole-sprouse-39-s-girlfriends-said-about-him>What Have Cole Sprouse's Girlfriends Said About Him?</h2><p>Perhaps the comment that stands out the most about what it is like to date Cole Sprouse came from his ex-girlfriend and former co-star, Lili Reinhart. But the couple were reluctant to speak about their relationship, instead keeping it protected.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/did-lili-reinhart-encourage-her-new-boyfriend-jack-martin-to-troll-cole-sprouse-s-notorious-call-her-daddy-interview_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a story for Teen Vogue in 2018, Reinhart gave a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">glimpse into what it was like being with Cole Sprouse</a> (and it sounds like it was a lot of fun). "I like to go on adventures with Cole," she said. "Truly, adventures. He takes me to places where I'm like, 'How did you find this?' He's made me see these things that I would have never seen otherwise. It's escapism, which is so beautiful and wonderful."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Dylan And Cole Sprouse's Mom Has Lived An Unconventional Life After Losing Her Custody Battle</a></span></p><p>Lili Reinhart also shared how she processed the breakup, with her comments suggesting that she was deeply in love and committed. "It was f***ing rough, and there's no other way through it than just through it," she told Refinery29.</p><p>"I've seen a lot of people when it comes to heartache and grief and breakups, and they try to get that void filled with s**, with c*ke, with food, with drinking, [but] the void is still there. I took the road less traveled and just dealt with my s***. I had to face my own pain head-on."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/what-cole-sprouse-is-really-like-to-date-according-to-his-current-and-ex-girlfriends.jpg><p>Ari Fournier is Cole Sprouse's current girlfriend, and she, like him, prefers to keep their relationship out of the public eye. Although, she does post photos of them and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sweet tributes for special occasions</a>.</p><p>For example, Sprouse's 30th birthday.</p><p>"Hard to describe with a couple photos how much fun we have together & how much I love celebrating life every day with you," she wrote. "I'm truly the luckiest girl in the world. Happy birthday my love, here's to 30."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/did-cole-and-dylan-sprouse-hookup-with-any-of-their-suite-life-of-zack-and-cody-co-stars_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And when they celebrated two years together in 2023, she wrote another sweet message. "2 years??! Someone please explain to me how did it go by so fast," she captioned photos of them on Instagram. But not much else is known about their coupling, although they appear serious.</p><h2 id=what-has-cole-sprouse-said-about-his-relationships>What Has Cole Sprouse Said About His Relationships?</h2><p>Cole Sprouse seems to be a gentleman when it comes to his relationships, specifically later in life. What he has said about his exes has been incredibly positive. For example, <a href=#>when he and Lili Reinhart split</a>, he made a statement about the relationship that was respectful and kind.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cole-sprouse.jpg><p>"Lili and I initially separated in January of this year, deciding to more permanently split in March," he wrote on Instagram in August 2020 (via Us Weekly).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"What an incredible experience I had, I'll always feel lucky and cherish that I had the chance to fall in love.
