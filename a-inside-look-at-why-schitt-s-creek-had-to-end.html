The family comedy was created by father and son duo Eugene and Daniel Levy, with Eugene starring as Johnny Rose, the patriarch of the family. Since it's inception in 2015, the Canadian network Pop TV provided&nbsp;Schitt's Creek the opportunity to thrive and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">change the modern idea of a sitcom</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Schitt's Creek follows the lives of the once very wealthy Rose family. After everything is taken from them due to the trouble of a bad business associate, the family resorts to their only remaining asset; a small town called Schitt's Creek. Eugene Levy as Johnny is the perfect character to lead this riches to rags story, along with Catherine O'Hara who plays his wife Moira. Dealing with new found poverty and the town they now own,&nbsp;Schitt's Creek follows the story of family and community in the absence of material goods.</p><h2 id=why-schitt-s-creek-had-to-end>Why Schitt's Creek Had To End</h2><p>Six seasons is a long run for a show and&nbsp;Schitt's Creek proved that fans would want even more. A natural conclusion is always something beneficial for any show, no matter how upsetting an end is for fans. To let the show play out naturally and keep the plot organic is something far more appealing to creators than to ruin it by forcing what's not there. When&nbsp;Schitt's Creek was picked up for another two seasons after season 4, creator Daniel Levy said he began to plot the end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 TV Show To Watch On Netflix If You Already Miss Schitt's Creek</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with Variety</a>, Levy said, "I at no point wanted to compromise on quality or storytelling. It just didn't feel like it was worth the risk to take it any further." On top of that, after six seasons the creators and cast were ready for new opportunities and Levy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">signed a 3-year deal with Disney</a> as a result. Ultimately, it was the creators' choice to end the show, which is a nice sentiment to know such a beloved comedy wasn't kicked out by those higher up.</p><p>Schitt's Creek became so beloved by fans everywhere thanks to a deal between Pop TV and Netflix. With the streaming service able to reach such a large audience, the door opened for fans to fall in love with the struggling Rose's. Variety got a hold of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a Nielsen streaming report</a> that had&nbsp;Schitt's Creek as the second-most-watched series behind The Office. Questions as to why the show truly had to end, especially with its status on Netflix and in the eyes of fans, is something only the creators can answer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What it really comes down to is that ending on a high note is far better than burning out and being just another show. The emotion behind ending a show like&nbsp;Schitt's Creek is part of the whole process and realizing that people's love for the show comes out because of the real problems that a seemingly real family face is powerful for relatability.&nbsp;Schitt's Creek is relatable on the aspect of family, but also in the sense of resilience that drives the family's survival.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>15 Things That Happened BTS Of Schitt's Creek</a></span></p><p>Schitt's Creek will go down as one of the best family comedies in a long time. Although the decision to call it quits after six seasons is tough for fans to swallow, the ultimate goal was to keep the integrity of the show and not burn out and become just another comedy.&nbsp;Schitt's Creek's legacy is cemented in television for more than just being a quality show. Daniel Levy was awarded the GLAAD award for promoting acceptance in the LGBTQ community, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to CBC</a>. Having a pansexual character on the show was the first time one was depicted on television, further giving&nbsp;Schitt's Creek an overall legacy of love and acceptance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>15 Fun Facts About Schitt's Creek Even The Biggest Fans Didn't Know</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYZqGeqLalsYylpqijXZbBbsPHsmSsm5iewbW%2FjJypnp2bYrWisIytpmadnpl8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fa-inside-look-at-why-schitt-s-creek-had-to-end.html&text=A%20Inside%20Look%20At%20Why%20%27Schitt%27s%20Creek%27%20Had%20To%20End&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-inside-look-at-why-schitt-s-creek-had-to-end.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-inside-look-at-why-schitt-s-creek-had-to-end.html&title=A%20Inside%20Look%20At%20Why%20%27Schitt%27s%20Creek%27%20Had%20To%20End" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fa-inside-look-at-why-schitt-s-creek-had-to-end.html&title=A%20Inside%20Look%20At%20Why%20%27Schitt%27s%20Creek%27%20Had%20To%20End" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fa-inside-look-at-why-schitt-s-creek-had-to-end.html&title=A%20Inside%20Look%20At%20Why%20%27Schitt%27s%20Creek%27%20Had%20To%20End" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-inside-look-at-why-schitt-s-creek-had-to-end.html&description=A%20Inside%20Look%20At%20Why%20%27Schitt%27s%20Creek%27%20Had%20To%20End" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bobby-lashley-wants-wwe-to-make-cm-punk-work-for-things-and-prove-his-loyalty.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bobby Lashley Wants WWE To Make CM Punk Work For Things And Prove His Loyalty">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./vina-sky-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vina Sky Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
