He was born in Washington, DC in 1948. He began acting in the 70s, and although he would rise to fame in 1994 through his superhit movie, <i>Pulp Fiction,</i> his talent was seen from the start. Following that breakout performance, the star made one blockbuster movie after another and <a href=#>gained attention while also building a magnificent empire of $250 million</a>. His most notable films have an average gross of approximately $89.9 million.

He got adequate exposure to the world of cinema while learning about the importance of Black presence on the big screen, which inspired him to be a film star.</p><p>Jackson's childhood and adolescence were nurtured with the ideals of Black representation in mainstream media, and he was also involved in Black activism from a young age. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Biography</a>, he developed a particular knack for acting after sitting through a memorable performance of the Negro Ensemble Company and soon began to pursue an acting course. He received a degree in 1972.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-dazzling-acting-career>A Dazzling Acting Career</h2><p>Jackson got himself an early-stage career when he was part of the theater alongside his future wife, LaTanya Richardson. He decided to get out of the political theater and upgrade Hollywood. As a result, the actor <a href=#>moved to New York</a> in 1976 to pursue a real career in acting. He started with Off-Broadway Productions and got a chance to act in Richard Wesley's <i>'The Mighty Gents</i>.'</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>6 Actors Who Crossed $100 Million Multiple Times At The Box Office</a></span></p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Jackson was introduced to the famous director Spike Lee after his 1981 performance in 'A Soldier's Play.'

He earned considerable recognition through performances in '<i>Goodfellas,' 'True Romance,' 'Jurassic Park,'</i> and<i> 'Amos and Andrew'</i>, to name a few. The star also became part of top-rated franchises like George Lucas' <i>'Star Wars'</i> in the character of the Jedi Master Mace Windu. Among his other famous 1990s, movies are <i>'A Time to Kill' (1996)</i> and '<i>The Negotiator' (1998)</i>. The star also had a mind-blowing performance in movies like '<i>Snakes On A Plane</i>,' released in 2006, and <i>'Kong: Skull Island</i>,' which came out in 2017.</p><p>His fame catapulted when<a href=#> he became part of the Marvel franchise</a> with the iconic character of Nick Fury.

Marvel has been one of the highest-grossing movie franchises in his entire acting career. <i>'Avengers: Endgame,'</i> released in 2019, has a lifetime gross of over $803,000,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jackson is particularly famous for working with the talented director Quentin Tarantino. Among his best hits are 'Pulp Fiction' released in 1994, 'Jackie Brown' in 1997, 'Django Unchained' in 2012, and 'The Hateful Eight' in 2015.
