He was married two times with&nbsp;Dolores Osteen and Jean Shaffer. He has two sons named&nbsp;Joel Osteen and&nbsp;Paul Osteen and two daughters named and&nbsp;Tamara Osteen. He has a daughter-in-law named&nbsp;Victoria Osteen (Joel Osteen’s wife).

Within a few months, he began preaching in Paris, Texas and was apparently ordained by a church affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention to the ministry of the Gospel shortly before his 18th birthday. After completing his studies at NBTS, he served as an Associate Pastor at First Baptist Church in San Diego, Texas and as a minister at First Baptist Church, Hamlin, Texas, in the late 1940s. In 1948, Osteen left Hamlin to become an itinerant preacher, but he became pastor of the Central Baptist Church, Baytown, Texas, within one year.</p><p>Osteen and his first wife, Emma Jean Shaffer, began experiencing marital unrest and subsequently divorced during his pastoral care of the Central Baptist Church. On September 17, 1954, he married Dolores “Dodie” Pilgrim and resigned his pastorate the following year. Osteen returned to pastoral ministry at Hibbard Memorial Baptist Church, Houston, Texas for a short time, but left in 1958.</p><p>Lisa’s first daughter, John, and Dodie were born with severe health problems that same year. As he wrestled with her circumstances, his theological beliefs began to shift and he had ecstatic religious experiences based on what he called “the baptism of the Holy Ghost.” A year later, on Mother’s Day May 10, 1959, he and Dodie began the Lakewood Baptist Church as a church for charismatic Baptists in “a dusty, abandoned feed store” in northeast Houston. The church was soon dropped from its name by “Baptist” and became non-denominational.</p><p>Osteen launched the Lakewood Bible Institute (LBI) in the mid-1980s, an “unaccredited school devoted to biblical training from a charismatic perspective.” LBI offered a variety of classes including Bible study, healing, conversion, and prayer principles. Osteen served as president of LBI until it was shut down in the late 1980s</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=john-osteen-children></span>John Osteen Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Justin, Paul, Lisa, April, Tamara, and pastor&nbsp;Joel Osteen</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=john-osteen-son-joel-osteen></span>John Osteen Son | Joel Osteen<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Osteen, born in Houston, Texas, is one of six children of the pilgrim John Osteen and Dolores (“Dodie”). His father, a former Southern Baptist minister, founded Lakewood Church in the back of an old feed store (of which Osteen is the present senior pastor).&nbsp;He was educated at Humble High School, a public high school in the city of Humble, Texas, from which he graduated in 1981, followed by Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he studied radio and television broadcasting but did not graduate; he did not receive a degree from a school of divinity. In 1982, he returned to Houston and founded Lakewood’s television program, where he produced his father’s televised sermons for 17 years until January 1999, when his father died unexpectedly from a heart attack.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=john-osteen-books></span><span>John Osteen Books</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>2013-Living in the Abundance of God</li><li>2012-Your Words Hold a Miracle: The Power of Speaking God’s Word</li><li>2012-Power Over the Enemy: Breaking Free from Spiritual Strongholds</li><li>2012-Becoming a Man of Unwavering Faith</li><li>1972-Pulling Down Strongholds</li><li>1968- You Can Change Your Destiny</li><li>1972-There is a Miracle in Your Mouth</li><li>1978-How to Flow in the Super Supernatural</li><li>1978-How to Demonstrate Satan’s Defeat</li><li>1983-The Confessions of a Baptist Preacher</li><li>1978-Rivers of Living Water</li><li>1982-A Place Called There</li><li>1984-Reigning in Life As a King</li><li>1978-How to Claim the Benefits of the Will</li><li>1988-A Miracle for Your Marriage</li><li>1987-Unraveling the Mystery of the Blood Covenant</li><li>1980-The Sixth Sense… Faith</li><li>1978-The Divine Flow</li><li>1981-What to Do When the Tempter Comes</li><li>1978-The Truth Shall Set You Free</li><li>1980-The Believer’s #1 Need</li><li>1970-The Bible Way to Spiritual Power</li><li>1988-Believing God for Your Loved Ones</li><li>1987-Overcoming Hindrances to Receiving the Baptism in the Holy Spirit</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=john-osteen-funeral></span><span>John Osteen Funeral</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=john-osteen-death></span><span>John Osteen Death</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On January 23, 1999, he died after a heart attack at the age of 77</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=john-osteen-quotes></span><span>John Osteen Quotes</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>“You cannot think negative thoughts and expect to live a positive life.”</li><li>“Satan’s purpose is to take from you what God has given you.”</li><li>“Faith is agreeing with God and saying what He says about you.”</li><li>“You have been conveyed into God’s kingdom to help others get out.
