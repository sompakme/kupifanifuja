MTV first went on the air in 1982 and was the first network of its kind to utilize "Video Jockeys," like radio DJs but, you know, with music videos.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The State Is An MTV Cult Classic, But Where Is The Cast Today?</a></span>The original MTV VJs were Alan Hunter, J.J. Jackson, Nina Blackwood, Martha Quinn, and Mark Goodman. However, over the years many VJs have come and gone from the network, some continued their careers in music, others branched into acting or continued hosting shows on other networks, and some just fell off the map completely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alan-hunter><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Alan Hunter</span></h2><p>Alan Hunter was one of the five original VJs. Not only that, <a href=#>he was the first ever to host any MTV show</a>, and he was the face that the MTV audience saw first when it debuted. Today, Alan lives in Birmingham Alabama, where he runs a film studio and a music/entertainment venue called Workplay. He also hosts the show The Eighties on 8 which airs on Sirius XM radio.</p><h2 id=j-j-jackson><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>J.J. Jackson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jackson was the older one of the original VJs and had already worked as a radio DJ and as a music reporter for Los Angeles' ABC affiliate, KABC-TV. Jackson was most known for hosting MTV's coverage of the famous Live Aid charity concert. Sadly, he died in 2004 from heart failure.</p><h2 id=nina-blackwood><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Nina Blackwood</span></h2><p>Blackwood was with MTV until 1986. When she left she continued hosting, and she became responsible for Entertainment Tonight's "Rock Report." She now hosts two radio shows, Nina Blackwood's Absolutely 80s, and co-hosts The 80s on 8 with Alan Hunter.</p><h2 id=martha-quinn><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Martha Quinn</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Quinn was only 22 when she joined MTV and many fans considered her "MTVs Best VJ," according to Biography. Quinn was originally an actress and had done a few commercials before MTV. She then went on to have roles in shows like Full House and The Bradys and co-hosted Star Search, which was sort of the '90s version of America's Got Talent. She now hosts iHeartRadio's iHeartThe80s and a podcast called Talk Talk With Martha Quinn.</p><h2 id=mark-goodman><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Mark Goodman</span></h2><p>Goodman, like many of his fellow VJs, continued to work in music after leaving MTV in 1987. He has worked for KROQ, Soundbreak.com, and VH1 Classic, and he was the music supervisor for a little-known show called Desperate Housewives. He co-hosts The 80s on 8 with Hunter and Blackwood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Stars Who Got Their Start On MTV's The Real World</a></span></p><h2 id=john-sencio><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>John Sencio</span></h2><p>Sencio was MTV's early morning host of Rude Awakening.

Fuentes was also a model and was used in ad campaigns for Budweiser and other products, and worked heavily in the fashion industry, selling makeup, clothes, and perfume. Fuentes continues to host, she is now on the show A New Leaf. Fun fact, she was MTV's first Latina VJ.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-curry><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Adam Curry</span></h2><p>Curry started as the host of Headbangers and The Top 20 Video Countdown in 1987.

She was also the voice of Linda Otter in The Fantastic Mr. Fox. Duffy suffers from neurosarcoidosis, which is why she is so on and off again with her acting career.</p><h2 id=tyrese-gibson><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Tyrese Gibson</span></h2><p>That's right, Roman Pearce from The Fast And The Furious films was a VJ in the late 1990s. He took on the job to supplement his music career, which helped take off thanks to the publicity he garnered from his MTV work. In 2021, the musician and actor began <a href=#>a messy divorce process </a>with his now ex-wife, Samantha Lee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bill-bellamy><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Bill Bellamy</span></h2><p>Bellamy started as the host of MTV Beach House in 1993.

He joined the network in the late '90s and quickly became the host of TRL, and was arguably the show's most famous host. He stayed with the network until the mid-2000s and then ventured off into the world of hosting and journalism for other networks.
