In a sense, her movies take a light approach with a direct delivery, something that only few comedians have mastered – and she is without a doubt effortlessly funny.</p><p>As far as her movies and various appearances in shows go, she has featured in varied projects. Let's take a look into her top ten funniest movies, ranked in order of their average box office revenues.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Jake-Gyllenhaal.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Highest-Grossing Jake Gyllenhaal Movies, Ranked</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Hollywood superstar Jake Gyllenhaal has more than a handful of blockbusters to his name.</span><h2 id=bridesmaids-2011-288-4-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Bridesmaids (2011): $288.4 Million</strong></span></h2><p>Released in 2011, this film features a group of misfit bridesmaids who run into a series of misadventures – all that lead to a wedding, with a hilarious twist. McCarthy is featured as Meghan who takes the role of a foul-mouthed and excessive bridesmaid that commands every scene she is in.</p><p>The film comes top of the list, having grossed about $288.4 million at box office.</p><h2 id=spy-2015-235-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Spy (2015): $235 Million</strong></span></h2><p>Second on the list is the movie Spy, released in 2015, which grossed $235 million in box office revenue. The movie involves McCarthy as a desk jockey who has to step up to be a spy, in order to investigate the missing case of a CIA agent.</p><p>The film features other big names too, including action star Jason Statham; it has a number of hilarious scenes, a funny vibe, and is an overall good movie to watch. By virtue of these numbers, it takes second on the list of McCarthy's biggest box office hits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-heat-2013-229-9-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>The Heat (2013): $229.9 Million</strong></span></h2><p>Featuring <a href=#>Sandra Bullock</a> as a "by the book" FBI agent, McCarthy plays a foul-mouthed B-Cop. At the beginning of The Heat, the two hate each other – but eventually work together and become friends (who take down a drug lord).</p><p>The two are polar opposites and do not get along (or agree on anything), but eventually find common ground. The movie is action packed and funny, and grossed about $229.9 Million in box office revenues – making it third on the list.</p><h2 id=identity-thief-2013-173-9-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Identity Thief (2013): $173.9 Million</strong></span></h2><p>Jason Bateman features alongside McCathy in the 2013 film Identity Thief, as a mild-mannered business executive whose identity is stolen. In a bid to recover his image and clear his name, he gets to team up with Melissa McCarthy (playing a flamboyant con artist) to fix things.</p><p>Identity Thief grossed about $173 million, and as such ranks fourth on the list. Like all Melissa McCarthy movies, this film has a blend of stupidly funny jokes, and a light but interesting storyline – plus a plot that can keep anyone's attention throughout, while generally delivering a good experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix added Identity Thief</a> in some regions (including the United States) in October 2023.</p><h2 id=tammy-2014-100-3-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Tammy (2014): $100.3 Million</strong></span></h2><p>Released in 2014 and with a gross box office revenue of $100.3 million, Tammy features McCarthy as a woman who loses her relationship and job – and as a result, sets out on a road trip with her alcoholic grandmother (played by Susan Sarandon).

This film follows a mother who is newly divorced, returning to college to complete her degree, who ends up bonding with her daughter's friends.</p><p>Life Of The Party grossed about $105 million in box office revenue, earning it a position on this list – and a recommendation as something anyone has to watch at least once.</p><h2 id=the-happytime-murders-2018-72-3-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>The Happytime Murders (2018): $72.3 Million</strong></span></h2><p>The Happytime Murders is set in a world where puppets are alive, and in it, they cohabit and exist in unison with humans. The film centers on a private investigator who is tasked to stop the murder spree of retired sitcom stars.</p><p>Even in this scenario (and with puppets), McCarthy makes this film something fun and experimental but still entertaining – ranking it eighth on the list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=can-you-ever-forgive-me-2018-58-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Can You Ever Forgive Me? (2018): $58 Million</strong></span></h2><p>Can You Ever Forgive Me? features a biographer who revises her will and career by forging letters from deceased authors and playwrights. The movie was released in 2018 and features McCarthy in an atypical role.</p><p>Having grossed $58 million in revenue, it takes ninth on the list – and is a must-watch (as are the other entries on this list, and goes for McCarthy's body of work).</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/martin-scorsese.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Martin Scorsese: A Cinematic Genius's Top Grossing Films</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Join us as we go deep into the fascinating realm of Martin Scorsese's new film, and explore some of his highest-grossing masterpieces.</span><h2 id=superintelligence-2020-33-9-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>Superintelligence (2020) 33.9 Million</strong></span></h2><p>Superintelligence focuses on the exceptionally average Carol Peters, played by Melissa McCarthy.
