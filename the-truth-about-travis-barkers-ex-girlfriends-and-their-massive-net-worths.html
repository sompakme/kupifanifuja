More than that, since drummers tend to be in the background, it would have seemed exceedingly unlikely that Travis Barker would be a big deal after Blink 182’s rise and fall. Despite all of that, Blink 182’s drummer has continued to be in the spotlight ever since he became famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>All The Positive Ways Kourtney Kardashian And Travis Barker Have Influenced Each Other</a></span></p><p>On top of the influence that Travis Barker has had on popular music over the years, there has been a lot of focus on his personal life lately since he is dating <strong><a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a></strong>. Since it is known that Kardashian has a lot of money and <a href=#>Barker is very wealthy</a> too, it is clear they can afford an amazing life together. With that in mind, some people have been looking back on the women Barker has been involved with in the past and how much money they are worth.</p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-1-5-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Lindsay Lohan’s Net Worth Is $1.5 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During his time in the spotlight, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Travis Barker has been linked to a long list of women</a> including Lindsay Lohan who he reportedly briefly dated in 2007. At one time, Lohan was one of the most talked-about celebrities in the world as she was a successful pop star and she starred in many popular movies. Unfortunately, however, Lohan’s career hit the skids and she seemingly frittered away a lot of money. For that reason, she was worth only $800,000 at one point but according to celebritynetworth.com, Lohan’s current fortune amounts to $1.5 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Lindsay Lohan Ended Up With Her (Current) $800,000 Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=tara-reid-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-2-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Tara Reid’s Net Worth Is $2 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Years before she was linked to Travis Barker in 2009, Tara Reid seemingly was on top of the world since starring in American Pie made her internationally famous. Sadly, however, she would go on to star in many movies that flopped and the perception of Reid in Hollywood was damaged when she became a tabloid mainstay. Thankfully, Reid’s fortune turned around when a movie she starred In became a surprise sensation, Sharknado. Thanks to her role in that film and several of its sequels, Reid’s net worth is now $2 million according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><h2 id=arianny-celeste-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-3-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Arianny Celeste’s Net Worth Is $3 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout MMA and boxing history, it has been common practice for attractive women to come out to the ring or octagon holding up a placard that identifies what round is about to commence. Amazingly enough, many observers found Arianny Celeste so eye-grabbing when she performed in that role that she was launched to fame. While it has never been confirmed that they were involved, it is rumored that Celeste had a fling with Travis Barker in 2014 after her rise to fame. Also a model who once appeared in Playboy and a former television host, Celeste is worth $3 million according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><h2 id=kimberly-stewart-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-10-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kimberly Stewart’s Net Worth Is $10 Million</span></h2><p>As the daughter of one of the biggest music stars of all time, Rod Stewart, Kimberly Stewart has been in the spotlight to a certain degree since the day she was born. Considering that Kimberly has some insights into what it means to be a rock star, it makes sense that she dated Travis Barker in 2006. As an adult, Kimberly became a TV personality, model, and fashion designer and her multifaceted career has allowed her to amass a $10 million fortune according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shanna-moakler-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-15-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Shanna Moakler’s Net Worth Is $15 Million</span></h2><p>From 2004 until 2008, Travis Barker and Shanna Moakler were married and even though they had a messy breakup, a lot of people continue to associate them to this day. Outside of her famous relationship, Moakler also is a former pageant queen, Playboy Playmate of the Month, and “reality” TV star. Thanks to all of the ways she has managed to be paid the big bucks, Moakler is worth $15 million according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Say Shanna Moakler Break Up Is Because She's 'Obsessed' With Travis Barker</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rita-ora-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-30-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Rita Ora’s Net Worth Is $30 Million</span></h2><p>Over the last decade, Rita Ora has managed to remain relevant in one of the most cutthroat industries in the world, the music business. Of course, part of the reason why Ora has remained in the spotlight is people love gossiping about her including when she dated Travis Barker in 2015 and 2016. More importantly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ora has a $30 million fortune</a> according to celebritynetworth.com because she has released hit tunes like “Your Song”, “Anywhere”, and “I Will Never Let You Down”.</p><h2 id=paris-hilton-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-300-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Paris Hilton’s Net Worth Is $300 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As an heir to the massive Hilton hotel fortune, Paris Hilton was born into a family of great means. As a result, some people may assume she owes her fortune to that alone and that simply isn’t the case. After all, even though being born into a wealthy family gave Hilton a massive head start, she has proven to be a strong-willed business leader who can fend for herself. For that reason and Hilton’s ability to withstand every aspect of her life being spotlighted including her 2009 relationship with Travis Barker, she is worth $300 million according to celebritnetworth.com.</p><h2 id=rihanna-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-1-7-billion><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Rihanna’s Net Worth Is $1.7 Billion</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following the release of her debut studio album in 2005, it took no time at all for <a href=#>Rihanna</a> to become famous all over the world.
