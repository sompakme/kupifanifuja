We see them every week in our homes and we&nbsp;start to think of them as friends of sorts, as people that we would really enjoy meeting if we had the opportunity to. They get into our hearts and we start thinking of them as people that we truly care about, and that care about us, after all, they just seem like such nice people, like total sweethearts even.</p><p>The thing is though, some of these people aren't quite as nice as they appear. In fact, in real life, a lot of these people are total jerks. It doesn't make anyone happy to have to deal with this fact, but hey, the truth hurts. This is hard to face, none of us want to think our favorite stars are mean, but a lot of them are.</p><p>What follows is a list of television celebrities that act like complete jerks IRL. Some of them probably got spoiled by their success as big TV stars, while others were probably jerks all along. No matter how you slice it, the stars on this list are not nice, despite how they portray themselves on TV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=malcolm-jamal-warner><strong>Malcolm Jamal-Warner</strong></h2><p>Malcolm Jamal-Warner is best known for playing the role of Theo Huxtable on&nbsp;The Cosby Show.&nbsp;And when I say he is best known, I mean he has pretty much never done anything else of note in his career. Despite seeming sweet on television, apparently, he is a total jerk. This restaurant employee was not impressed by Jamal-Warner.&nbsp;"He made it seem like speaking to a waitress was just beneath him. He expressed distaste for the menu, the food, the atmosphere, basically everything. He complained that people were ogling him even though I never saw anyone look his way. He also did not tip. He tipped none of the times he came into our restaurant and he treated all of us poorly." You're a jerk Malcolm.</p><h2 id=ariana-grande><strong>Ariana Grande</strong></h2><p>While Ariana Grande is well known as a singer, she started out on TV&nbsp;when she appeared on Nickelodeon's&nbsp;Victorious&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;Sam &Cat.&nbsp;While she may appear nice on television, the fact is that she is a total jerk. There have been entire articles about what a total diva she is. In fact, her&nbsp;Sam & Cat&nbsp;co-star Jeannette McCurdy once wrote,"Where did I go? As far away from you as I can get. You won't be hearing from me anymore because sweetheart, being a friend to you was doing so much more for you than it was doing for me. You sucked the life right out of me, and I want my life back."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christina-aguilera><strong>Christina Aguilera</strong></h2><p>Pretty much everyone knows that Christina Aguilera can be a total jerk, but some people still think she is a sweetheart. She is well known for her work on television, whether it be for the&nbsp;Mickey Mouse Club&nbsp;or&nbsp;Star Search&nbsp;when she was young, to shows like&nbsp;The Voice.&nbsp;All sorts of people from Eminem to Valerie Bertinelli have come out and said they simply can't stand her. Every once in a great while, one might get a bad reputation that isn't deserved, but when you think about it, pretty much everyone thinks that Christina is a total jerk. Let's face it, where there's smoke, there's usually fire, and even though Christina might act nice on television, it seems IRL, she is a total jerk.</p><h2 id=ashton-kutcher><strong>Ashton Kutcher</strong></h2><p>A lot of people seem to think that Ashton Kutcher is a total sweetheart, and I get that, at least a little bit. He is one of the biggest television stars around, having starred in&nbsp;That 70s Show, Punked,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Two and a Half Men.&nbsp;But the thing is, in reality, he is kind of a jerk. There are stories out there of him throwing his weight around and acting like a jerk when he is around people that don't treat him like he is a huge star. He is that kind of guy that a lot of us know in real life, the type that seems nice, but when you get to know them a little better, they show their true colors and act like they are better than anyone else. Yeah Ashton, we get it, you are handsome, but you're still a jerk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eva-longoria><strong>Eva Longoria</strong></h2><p>Eva Longoria has never had the best reputation, there have always been stories out there about how she is a bit of a jerk. If you just saw her on&nbsp;The Young and the Restless&nbsp;or&nbsp;Desperate Housewives,&nbsp;then you might be under the impression that she is quite the sweetheart, but nothing could be further from the truth. There have been numerous reports both from people she was working with and people in her life, that Eva has a bit of a mean side to her. One person that she worked with on a film actually had a <a href=#>sandwich</a> thrown at her by Eva. I have to say, when you start throwing your lunch at people on set, then you might have a bit of a problem.</p><h2 id=jessica-biel><strong>Jessica Biel</strong></h2><p>Jessica Biel is a jerk in real life? Oh come on, how could she possibly not be a sweetheart? It just isn't possible. She seemed nice on&nbsp;7th Heaven,&nbsp;that's for sure. But the thing is, sometimes, it isn't possible to tell what someone is really like when they are on television. It turns out, she was mean way back in middle school, as one former classmate <a href=#>says</a>,&nbsp;"she was constantly made fun of by Jessica Biel and her middle-school posse. She was totally stuck up and full of herself since before she became famous, probably more so afterward." Really Jessica? So you act super nice in front of the cameras and then&nbsp;make fun of people in private? So not cool!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tania-raymonde><strong>Tania Raymonde</strong></h2><p>Tania Raymonde has been on a whole bunch of television shows, including&nbsp;That's So Raven, Malcolm in the Middle,&nbsp;and Lost, and in all of them she appears to be someone nice, or at least someone who isn't actively mean. But not so fast, apparently she is pretty full of herself. One person that met her at a party said that Tania threw all sorts of shade at her just because she didn't know who Tania was and had never seen&nbsp;Lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously Tania? Just because you were on a couple of shows as a kid and were on a hit television show doesn't mean that everyone in the world is going to know you and love you. Just another example of someone who seems nice on TV but is a jerk IRL.</p><h2 id=tim-allen><strong>Tim Allen</strong></h2><p>Tim Allen is well known for playing a nice guy on television. Both in&nbsp;Home Improvement&nbsp;and&nbsp;Last Man Standing,&nbsp;he is thought of as a nice guy, even though he spent little time in prison back in the day for possession. But is he really a nice guy or is that just all an act? Well, it seems like he is a total jerk. There are<a href=#> stories</a>&nbsp; out there that say he is awful to people waiting on him and tips really badly. One time, he was so mean to a waitress, he made her cry. So next time you watch Tim Allen on TV and think about what a nice guy he seems to be, just remember that you are talking about a guy that went to prison and is totally mean to waitresses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vanessa-hudgens><strong>Vanessa Hudgens</strong></h2><p>Oh look, Vanessa Hudgens, talk about a total sweetheart! While she has had a long career already, it all started when she was in Disney's&nbsp;High School Musical&nbsp;series where she seemed about as sweet as she could possibly be. But is she in real life? While living as a celebrity is hard, there still have been some <a href=#>reports&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;that she can be rude to fans when they approach her and sometimes even laughs at them. Again, it is understandable that you might not want to be approached all the time by people out in public, and it must be hard to be sweet all of the time, but still, you have to hold it together.&nbsp;It can't be that hard to be somewhat pleasant to people.</p><h2 id=william-shatner><strong>William Shatner</strong></h2><p>William Shatner is one of the biggest TV stars of all time. He is most famous for being the star of&nbsp;Star Trek&nbsp;but he's been on television a lot.&nbsp;He is kind of a hard guy to figure out&nbsp;â€” sometimes he seems totally cool and other times, he seems like a complete idiot. So what is the truth?&nbsp; Well, there are a lot of stories out there about Shatner being a total jerk and rude to people, and they appear to be true. It's hard to tell whether or not he is actually a real jerk or totally insane, but I guess all that matters in the end is what he actually acts like. It's too bad, though. Star Trek fans deserve better than this guy to look up to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emeril-lagasse><strong>Emeril Lagasse</strong></h2><p>No one used to know who Emeril Lagasse was until his cooking show&nbsp;Emeril Live&nbsp;came out, and then everyone seemed to know who he was, even to the point of yelling his catchphrase "Bam!" over and over again. But, is he actually a sweetheart, or is he a total jerk? Well, I have to say there are a lot of people out there that <a href=#>say&nbsp;</a>that he's a bully, rude, and pushes people around. I get that part of his vibe is to play this guy who is funny and does and says things in a kind of loud way, but there is still no excuse to be a total jerk to people. Whatever is cooking with Emeril, it doesn't smell all that great. Did you see what I did there?</p><h2 id=bill-nye><strong>Bill Nye</strong></h2><p>Bill Nye has been getting by as "The Science Guy" on television for years. He has become a huge star over the years and is thought of as an expert on science, even though he isn't actually a scientist. Although he appears to be a really nice guy on TV, if you've seen him on news shows talking about things like climate change, you know he has a bit of a prickly side. It turns out he is kind of a jerk, as <a href=#>one person said</a>, "I told him he was my hero and that I'd love his autograph and he just yelled 'How many times do I have to remind people no autographs?' He then started going off on how he asked for a certain brand of water 5 minutes ago and that they brought him the wrong one." Bill Nye is no sweetheart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-hasselhoff><strong>David Hasselhoff</strong></h2><p>Everyone in the world knows who David Hasselhoff is&nbsp;â€” he is one of the most famous television stars in history. First, he was famous for&nbsp;Knight Rider&nbsp;and then&nbsp;became really famous for&nbsp;Baywatch.&nbsp;Now, it seems like he's a pretty nice guy, but as we know, his image took a bit of a hit from that video that his daughter took when he was shirtless, completely drunk and eating a cheeseburger. That seems to be a bit of a common theme. While it isn't thought that he is a total jerk, there have been a fair amount of stories out there about him acting a bit of a fool when he's in public, and a lot of them have included booze. Hoff, lay off the sauce!</p><h2 id=hulk-hogan><strong>Hulk Hogan</strong></h2><p>While people might not necessarily think that Hulk Hogan is a sweetheart, there is no doubt that he gives off a certain teddy-bear vibe, both as a wrestler and on&nbsp;Hogan Knows Best.&nbsp; There&nbsp;have also been plenty of times that he acts like a jerk, so which is it? Is Hogan a sweetheart or is he mean? There are<a href=#> stories</a>&nbsp;told by people that have seen him in public that he is generally rude and acts like a jerk all the time. I guess it isn't that surprising, as his whole scene is to kind of act like a blustery tough guy. But come on Hulk, show some class to your fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-schwimmer><strong>David Schwimmer&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Is there anyone that seems sweeter on TV than David Schwimmer? How could Ross from&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;possibly be mean? It just doesn't seem possible. But there are stories that suggest David is really rude to fans who ask him for autographs.&nbsp;Although it must be irritating to get asked for autographs when you are just trying to chill out, but still, if you are a famous TV star, especially one that is thought of as a sweetheart, you might want to step up your game a little bit. It isn't that hard to be nice unless you're a jerk.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrqaTlsGms86roLOdlGR%2BdnnTr2Ssr5WawamxwKurrGWnnbxurdGeZKOdoqDAbrXRpWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-tv-sweethearts-who-are-jerks-irl.html&text=15%20TV%20Sweethearts%20Who%20Are%20Jerks%20IRL&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-tv-sweethearts-who-are-jerks-irl.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-tv-sweethearts-who-are-jerks-irl.html&title=15%20TV%20Sweethearts%20Who%20Are%20Jerks%20IRL" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-tv-sweethearts-who-are-jerks-irl.html&title=15%20TV%20Sweethearts%20Who%20Are%20Jerks%20IRL" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-tv-sweethearts-who-are-jerks-irl.html&title=15%20TV%20Sweethearts%20Who%20Are%20Jerks%20IRL" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-tv-sweethearts-who-are-jerks-irl.html&description=15%20TV%20Sweethearts%20Who%20Are%20Jerks%20IRL" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./andreas-struengmann-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Andreas Struengmann Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jill-kortleve.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=" Jill Kortleve">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
