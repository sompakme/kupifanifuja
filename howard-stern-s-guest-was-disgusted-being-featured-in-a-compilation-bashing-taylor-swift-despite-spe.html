She had a lot to discuss, which included what went on behind the scenes during the Tom Brady roast, and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unaired moments</a>. In addition, she discussed how stand-up comedy saved her life, and her relationship with Chris Convy that has been on and off for a decade.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What tends to be a frequent topic of conversation on The Howard Stern Show is Taylor Swift. She was once again brought up with Nikki Glaser, but the topic had lots of meaning for the comedian. She's a huge Swiftie, but was featured in Taylor Swift's life for all the wrong reasons. Glaser's voice was in a compilation during Miss Americana, basically shading Taylor Swift and her friends. Glaser was heartbroken at the moment.</p><p>She tells Howard Stern, “I was mouthing off on some interview about her in a way that was not kind, but it was me being jealous and feeling like I couldn’t be friends with her,” Nikki told Howard. “Then it comes out in the documentary that she was anorexic. I was like, ‘What the f***?’”</p><p><strong>Glaser concludes, “I was commenting on somebody’s body who has the same f****** thing I did. It was so grotesque, so I issued an apology on Instagram."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-8.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Psychologist Believes Taylor Swift Is "Likely Autistic" Based On Her Music</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The psychologist also said Taylor Swift's music "would likely decrease" if she worked on her possible mental health issues.</span><p>A tough moment for Glaser but credit to the comedian for instantly making things right and issuing an apology. Not only that, but her fandom for Taylor doubled after the moment, and she ended up spending thousands on Swift's Eras Tour.</p><h2 id=nikki-glaser-spent-thousands-on-taylor-swift-39-s-eras-tour-attending-12-concerts>Nikki Glaser Spent Thousands On Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, Attending 12 Concerts</h2><p>12 different cities, and $25,000 was spent by Nikki Glaser during Taylor Swift's Eras tour. This all took place after Nikki decided against freezing her eggs at the last minute. Given all the costs she saved, Glaser decided to spoil herself with the added funds.</p><p>“I was [considering] freezing my eggs in case I break up with my boyfriend — who I don’t plan on breaking up with — and I meet a guy who refuses to adopt … and then I felt sad about it, so I said, ‘I’m not doing this’ … and that’s when the tour was announced,” Nikki told Howard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/your-paragraph-text-2024-04-29t125122-284.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift Had The Perfect Response To David Letterman After He Asked Why She Stopped Making "Snarky" Lyrics About Ex-Boyfriends</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift revealed the reason she didn't feel like writing about "lousy" ex-boyfriends on her "1989" album.</span><p>Glaser listened to her boyfriend's advice, and took advantage of the moment.</p><p><strong>“He said … ‘Who knows when she will [go on tour] again? It’s the thing that brings you the most joy … Taylor Swift is your life … Go to every chance you have.’ So, I did,” Glaser recalled, adding, “I was on [my comedy] tour last year … I did at least like 60 different cities, and I also went to 12 different cities for Taylor Swift. I went on like two tours.”</strong></p><p>Without a doubt, a moment Glaser won't ever forget.</p><h2 id=nikki-glaser-posted-a-lengthy-apology-on-instagram-after-bashing-taylor-swift>Nikki Glaser Posted A Lengthy Apology On Instagram After Bashing Taylor Swift</h2><p>Not only did Glaser feel awful about being included in the compilation, but in 2020, the comedian took to Instagram, posting an apology about being included in the Miss Americana documentary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She wrote in the post, "I love @taylorswift. Unfortunately, I am featured in her new documentary as part of a montage of a**hats saying mean things about her, which is used to explain why she felt the need to escape from the spotlight for a year. It’s insanely ironic because anyone who knows me knows I’m obnoxiously obsessed with her and her music. I first heard myself in the trailer last week as I watched it alone in bed (as soon as it came out bc I was so excited!) and I was horrified to hear my own voice."</p><p>She concluded, "In fact, her song “The Man” is the inspiration for my new hour of material and I feature the song is multiple iterations during my current tour.
