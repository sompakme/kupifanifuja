There are first-time boyfriend-girlfriend relationships, hormone monsters, and lots of hilarious (and sometimes weird) situations. The show follows Nick, Andrew, Jay, and Jesse, all young teens, and friends that go through all the drama that is high school. They go through scenarios like getting your first period and exploring your body for the first time. The show has become relatively popular since its release in 2017; the cast has also been successful. Here are all the net worths of the cast from&nbsp;Big Mouth.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;</span><a href=#>The Lion King Live Action Cast's Net Worth</a></p><h2 id=jason-mantzoukas---500-000>10.

Known for his roles in Brooklyn Nine-Nine, The Good Place, and Modern Family, Jason always plays the funniest, and sometimes the oddest, characters. In&nbsp;Big Mouth, Jason plays a character named Jay, who is the 'gross' one in the group. The episodes that revolve around Jay always seem to include his crazy brothers and neglectful mother, or his dog with self-esteem issues. In short, Jay's life doesn't seem like it's going all that great.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-thewlis---800-000>9.

His most notable role was the long-running character of Remus Lupin from the Harry Potter films, but he can also be seen in&nbsp;The Theory of Everything and&nbsp;The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. In&nbsp;Big Mouth, though, David Thewlis plays the Shame Wizard, a phantom that is from the same universe as Maury the Hormone Monster. His job is to make all of the kids feel shame for all the things they have done wrong. As infuriating the character can be, you learn to love him in the end.</p><h2 id=john-mulaney---3-million>8. John Mulaney - $3 million</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Glouberman</a>, one of the main characters in&nbsp;Big Mouth, is Nick's best friend and is the first person in the main friend group to hit puberty.

His voice actor, John Mulaney, though, seems to be quite the successful actor and comedian, being nominated for 24 awards, including eight Emmys having won five of them (two of the Emmys).</p><h2 id=jenny-slate---5-million>7. Jenny Slate - $5 million</h2><p>Born as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenny Sarah Slate</a> in 1982, this talented actress, comedian, and author has been in the business since 2005 and was even featured on&nbsp;Saturday Night Live as several characters from 2009 to 2010.

In&nbsp;Big Mouth she voices the other half of the over-sexual couple that is Nick Birch's parents.
