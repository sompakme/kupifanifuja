As a lead character, she also makes sure that her experience inspires the story.</p><p>Her performance in the TV series earned praises but was controversially not enough to earn her a Primetime Emmy Awards nomination. Hunter is already making her mark, and here's a look back at how she scored her first acting job.</p><h2 id=hunter-schafer-was-a-model-before-39-euphoria-39>Hunter Schafer Was A Model Before 'Euphoria'</h2><p>Before acting, Hunter was already cementing her name among modeling circles. In 2017, she was part of Versace's 'Sub-Versus Generation,' a group advanced by Donatella Versace for their beliefs and individuality. She was also a part of Marc Jacobs' #GratefulNotHateful campaign during its 2018 Pride celebration.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hunter was part of the new faces that walked the New York Fashion Week in 2018.

Though inexperienced, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vendetti praised Hunter for being a natural</a>, especially since she can relate to the demands of the character.</p><p>After getting the role, Hunter sat down with show creator Sam Levinson to discuss the story, her experiences as a trans woman, and how it would materialize in her role.</p><p>"It was really important to me that he would listen to us and be collaborative. And he has been all that and more," she shared with Entertainment Weekly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Euphoria, <a href=#>Hunter plays the role of Jules</a>, a transgender student who has a <a href=#>complicated relationship with Rue (Zendaya)</a>. Though the series is controversial for its sexual content and nudity, no one can argue about the show's effective approach to mature subject matters of identity, love, and sex, among others. The acting of Hunter was praised, too, especially for the special episode F*** Anyone Who's Not a Sea Blob, where Jules' character was the subject.</p><p>Hunter admitted she was reluctant at first to try acting since she wanted to focus on modeling.

She still doesn't know where to go next but is certain she wants to do more passion projects.</p><p>For those curious about her love life, <a href=#>she's dating singer and co-star Dominic Fike</a> (who plays the role of Elliot).
