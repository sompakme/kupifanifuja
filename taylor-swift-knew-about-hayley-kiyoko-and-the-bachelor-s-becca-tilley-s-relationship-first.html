Still, when singer Hayley Kiyoko revealed Swift was one of the first people to know about her private relationship with Bachelor star Becca Tilley, fans were surprised.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift revealed that her friendship with Kiyoko actually started after the singer publicly called out Swift to the media. After Kiyoko was criticized for only singing about girls and making music about girls she made a comment about Swift's music back in 2018. She was referring to Swift always singing about men and how it is a double standard that people are asking why she herself only sings about girls.</p><p>Swift replied to the comment by saying, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"People don't give me s***the way they give her s*** for singing about girls — and it's totally valid."</a> It was nice for fans to hear Swift taking the criticism that Kiyoko spoke about and validating her feelings.</p><p>That apparently led to a new friendship for Swift and Kiyoko.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-hayley-kiyoko-and-how-close-are-she-and-taylor>Who Is Hayley Kiyoko (And How Close Are She And Taylor)?</h2><p>Fans love Kiyoko because she is so open about her sexuality. It is not seen often, and she has become a role model for women that are queer. After this, the two formed a bond and friendship. Swift sang Delicate with Kiyoko at the Ally Coalition benefit concert. Kiyoko came out after Swift's show and the two sang Kiyoko's song Curious together.</p><p>It was clear to fans that no issues stemmed from the interviews and the two were definitely friends.</p><p>Kiyoko appeared in Swift's music for her Lover song, You Need To Calm Down. This music video featured a lot of queer icons, like the cast of Queer Eye and countless drag queens as well. Swift released a documentary called Miss Americana, where she opened up about political issues for the first time in her career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Taylor Swift Is The Perfect Role Model</a></span></p><p>She admits she has always been nervous to speak about politics and <a href=#>expressed that after the Dixie Chicks spoke about the war, they were ostracized for years</a>.This made Swift scared for her own career if she ever spoke out, also noting that her team usually tried to stray her away from speaking up as well.</p><h2 id=hayley-kiyoko-and-becca-tilley-39-s-relationship>Hayley Kiyoko And Becca Tilley's Relationship</h2><p>Becca Tilley was on seasons 19 and 20 of the hit show, The Bachelor. The show is known for men and women finding love, but there has never been a season featuring any queer relationships. Although, Becca Tilley is not the first queer woman to appear on the show. <a href=#>W</a></p><p>hen Demi Burnett was on the sixth season of the spin-off show, Bachelor in Paradise, she found love with another woman. She came out as sexually fluid after the season premiered.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘The Bachelor’: Queer Icon Demi Burnett Reveals She Is Also Jewish</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kiyoko and Tilley announced their four-year relationship in a recent music video of Kiyoko's. The music video was Bachelorette themed for her song, For The Girls. The two have both hinted that they were a relationship prior to announcing it to the world. They were both clear that they were happy about having a private relationship.</p><p>At the end of the music video, Tilley is seen getting out of a car and Kiyoko gives her a smile, indicating that she is the one for her. During the premiere, Kiyoko handed Tilley the final rose and pulled her in for an embrace and a kiss.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=becca-tilley-reveals-taylor-swift-was-the-first-to-know>Becca Tilley Reveals Taylor Swift Was The First To Know</h2><p>In Tilley's podcast, she reveals why the two decided to tell Taylor Swift first. She said, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“The first person who found out outside of my family and friends in a weird way... was Taylor Swift."</a> Tilley said she has been a Taylor Swift stan forever and when she met her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"it felt like talking to a friend."</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Queer Fans Think Taylor Swift Is Serving Major Queer Vibes</a></span></p><p>Not only was this extremely heartwarming to fans, but it also solidified just how close Swift and Kiyoko are. Another reason fans speculated that Swift was the first to know is that <a href=#>Swift herself keeps her relationship with her boyfriend Joe Alwyn private</a>. The two rarely talk about their relationship. Recently they have a little more but for both of their sakes, they agreed it's best to keep it out of the public eye as much as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were so excited and happy for Kiyoko and Tilley. The two seem extremely happy and Kiyoko is once again becoming an inspiration for her queer fans. Whether it helps them accept their identities or even come out, it is certainly a special thing for fans to see representation in the mainstream media.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Truth Behind Taylor Swift's Friendship With Phoebe Bridgers</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lm6OyuHnHmrClnaliuKrFzqSmZqyYmnqjrcKhnKWnomKvpq%2FCmmStoZyhsrp50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-knew-about-hayley-kiyoko-and-the-bachelor-s-becca-tilley-s-relationship-first.html&text=Taylor%20Swift%20Knew%20About%20Hayley%20Kiyoko%20And%20The%20Bachelor%27s%20Becca%20Tilley%27s%20Relationship%20First&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-knew-about-hayley-kiyoko-and-the-bachelor-s-becca-tilley-s-relationship-first.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-knew-about-hayley-kiyoko-and-the-bachelor-s-becca-tilley-s-relationship-first.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20Knew%20About%20Hayley%20Kiyoko%20And%20The%20Bachelor%27s%20Becca%20Tilley%27s%20Relationship%20First" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftaylor-swift-knew-about-hayley-kiyoko-and-the-bachelor-s-becca-tilley-s-relationship-first.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20Knew%20About%20Hayley%20Kiyoko%20And%20The%20Bachelor%27s%20Becca%20Tilley%27s%20Relationship%20First" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-knew-about-hayley-kiyoko-and-the-bachelor-s-becca-tilley-s-relationship-first.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20Knew%20About%20Hayley%20Kiyoko%20And%20The%20Bachelor%27s%20Becca%20Tilley%27s%20Relationship%20First" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-knew-about-hayley-kiyoko-and-the-bachelor-s-becca-tilley-s-relationship-first.html&description=Taylor%20Swift%20Knew%20About%20Hayley%20Kiyoko%20And%20The%20Bachelor%27s%20Becca%20Tilley%27s%20Relationship%20First" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-16-best-wrestlemania-stages-ever.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 16 Best Wrestlemania Stages Ever">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rihanna-shaves-her-head-in-bold-move-after-launching-new-hair-care-line.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rihanna Shaves Her Head In Bold Move After Launching New Hair Care Line">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
