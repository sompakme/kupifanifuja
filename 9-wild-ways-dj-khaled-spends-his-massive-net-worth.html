Although the record label executive has achieved outstanding success in his career, it wasn't always roses for him. Khaled had come a long way from his early days, when he started with a job at a record store, Odyssey, to becoming a radio host in the late 90s before gaining considerable recognition as DJ/ producer for the Terror Squad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="The 9 Highest-Grossing DJ Khaled Songs, Ranked">The 9 Highest-Grossing DJ Khaled Songs, Ranked</a></span></p><p>Khaled translated his success with the group into working on his projects. And in over 16 years, with 13 studio albums to his credit, the musician has become a formidable force in the industry. Khaled's hard work has earned him a fortune, and the larger-than-life entertainer doesn't hold back on spending his massive net worth.</p><h2 id=dj-khaled-has-a-luxury-car-collection><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>DJ Khaled Has A Luxury Car Collection</span></h2><p>One thing that points clearly to <a href=#>his impressive $75 million net worth</a> is his collection of luxury cars. Like many high-profile entertainers, Khaled's automotive preferences are in the costliest of cars available in limited quantities. Khaled spoke fluent exclusivity when he splurged over $1.3 million on the 2012 Maybach 62S Landaulet, making him one of the eight luxury vehicle owners.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other luxurious cars in his collection include the Rolls-Royce Phantom EWB VIII, Cadillac Escalade, Rolls-Royce Phantom VIII, Rolls-Royce Dawn, Maybach 57S, and Rolls-Royce Cullinan SUV.</p><h2 id=dj-khaled-owns-a-personal-champs-sports-store><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>DJ Khaled Owns A Personal Champs Sports Store</span></h2><p>On first look, the entertainer owning a Champs store appears like a business investment for shoes, but that is miles far from its intended purpose. The store, which is located next to his Miami studio, will function differently than a traditional retail outfit. Access to the store is restricted to Khaled's inner circle, with everything in the outfit going for free. The store could be considered a showroom with Champs stocks placed on constant rotation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dj-khaled-39-s-mansion><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>DJ Khaled's Mansion</span></h2><p>Nothing screams high-end luxury than owning a 10,681-square-foot house on three-quarters of an acre in the prestigious Mulholland Estate community, Beverly Hills. T</p><p>he gated community has played and continues to play host to certain A-listers in the entertainment world. Perhaps that was why Khaled paid $10,000,000 for the mansion in 2016. Five years later, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Khaled unloaded his sprawling Beverly Hills mansion for $12.5 million</a>, which implies that he made a profit of over $2 million.</p><p><span class=next-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Fans Get Inside Look At Drake, DJ Khaled And Fat Joe’s Feast Fit For Kings">Fans Get Inside Look At Drake, DJ Khaled And Fat Joe’s Feast Fit For Kings</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dj-khaled-39-s-expensive-shoe-collection><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>DJ Khaled's Expensive Shoe Collection</span></h2><p>Shoes speak louder than words, and Khaled understands this to the T. The Grammy-award winner is particularly in love with sneakers - <a href=#>he once spent $25,000 on these shoes</a>. With a sneaker room dedicated to his over 10,000 pairs, multiple collaborations with brands, and an estimated $8 million worth of footwear, it is safe to call the record executive a verified sneaker head.</p><h2 id=dj-khaled-is-crazy-about-jewelry-pieces><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>DJ Khaled Is Crazy About Jewelry Pieces</span></h2><p>Khaled cannot be found in the number when it comes to subtlety, and his jewelry pieces prove it. While he may not be among <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrities with the most extensive collection of jewels and diamonds</a>, his collection is almost as impressive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The musician is always donned in the boldest diamond-crested jewelry to accentuate his flamboyance. Among his jewelry collection is the 14k gold ruby<a href=#> 'We The Best' pendant, which probably costs more than your house</a>.</p><h2 id=dj-khaled-enjoys-expensive-holidays><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>DJ Khaled Enjoys Expensive Holidays</span></h2><p>The record label executive knows how to put in the work, but when it comes to holidays, he plays just as hard as he works. Like most of his lifestyle choices, Khaled's vacation options embody luxury and exclusivity.</p><p>In 2019, the musician enjoyed a family vacation at Rio Chico Villa, Jamaica - an exclusive 14-acre private property costing a whopping $6,430 per night.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Here's Why Fans Think DJ Khaled Might Not Be As Popular Anymore">Here's Why Fans Think DJ Khaled Might Not Be As Popular Anymore</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dj-khaled-made-a-custom-jacket-out-of-scarves><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>DJ Khaled Made A Custom Jacket Out Of Scarves</span></h2><p>The year is 2016, and everyone, including Goyard, is wondering why Khaled is wearing a 'fake' Goyard bomber jacket. It turned out that the musician had a custom jacket made out of silk scarves by the luxury brand.</p><p>The jacket was made with around 3-5 yards of the scarf, with each one retailing at $1,795. Following the uproar, GQ's analysis of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">everything to know about DJ Khaled's costly "fake" Goyard jacket</a> pegged the amount of making the custom bomber jacket at approximately $30,000.</p><h2 id=dj-khaled-splurges-on-presents><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>DJ Khaled Splurges On Presents</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether it's for his friends or family, one thing is sure; the celebrity disc jockey goes all out when it comes to gifting. To celebrate his first son Asahd's birthday, the joyous father gifted his son a Frank Muller watch worth US$ 100,000.</p><p>Khaled's generosity extends to friends, team, and charity. Some of his outrageous generosity includes gifting Stormi Webster her first Chanel bag, gifting his team $10,000 Rolex watches, and giving $100,000 in scholarships to high school students in Miami.</p><h2 id=dj-khaled-owns-a-private-jet><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>DJ Khaled Owns A Private Jet</span></h2><p>For years, Khaled nurtured a deep-rooted fear of flying, so much so that he avoided traveling by air for ten years. But all that changed when he became a father; he conquered his fear of flying and acquired a Gulfstream G650 private jet to suit his luxurious lifestyle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In classic Khaled fashion, the musician is looking to make a fleet; in October, he was spotted shopping for a VIP Boeing 767.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhwZq%2BZobFuw8CyqmacmmK4qa3Lnptmq6Cau6W%2FjKGgrGWdlsC0tdWeZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f9-wild-ways-dj-khaled-spends-his-massive-net-worth.html&text=9%20Wild%20Ways%20DJ%20Khaled%20Spends%20His%20Massive%20Net%20Worth%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f9-wild-ways-dj-khaled-spends-his-massive-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f9-wild-ways-dj-khaled-spends-his-massive-net-worth.html&title=9%20Wild%20Ways%20DJ%20Khaled%20Spends%20His%20Massive%20Net%20Worth%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f9-wild-ways-dj-khaled-spends-his-massive-net-worth.html&title=9%20Wild%20Ways%20DJ%20Khaled%20Spends%20His%20Massive%20Net%20Worth%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f9-wild-ways-dj-khaled-spends-his-massive-net-worth.html&title=9%20Wild%20Ways%20DJ%20Khaled%20Spends%20His%20Massive%20Net%20Worth%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f9-wild-ways-dj-khaled-spends-his-massive-net-worth.html&description=9%20Wild%20Ways%20DJ%20Khaled%20Spends%20His%20Massive%20Net%20Worth%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./did-katy-perry-refuse-to-speak-to-russell-brand-ever-again-following-their-scandalous-divorce.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Katy Perry Refuse To Speak To Russell Brand Ever Again Following Their Scandalous Divorce?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./17-winter-dresses-perfect-for-every-occasion.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="17 Winter Dresses Perfect for Every Occasion">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
