She looks absolutely amazing. Heather has managed to look timeless over the years. We have the pictures to prove it. Her beauty has only blossomed, and at 53, Heather Graham is a bombshell. Below we have some classic movie and red carpet pics, plus more importantly, what skincare products does she use? We have talked about a lot of young actresses who have <a href=#>beautiful skin, like Sydney Sweeney</a>. As well as models like <a href=#>Delilah Belle Hamlin</a> and <a href=#>Rosie Huntington-Whiteley</a> and their beauty routines, but we need Heather Graham's info STAT!</p><h2 id=young-heather-graham>Young Heather Graham</h2><p>Heather Graham was born in Milwaukee, WI, in January 1970. That makes her around 20 to 30 years old in the first group of pictures. During that time frame, Heather Graham was really busy! Here is a quick run-down of some of her work in that decade. In 1988's action film License to Drive, Heather played Mercedes Lane in her first prominent leading role. She also appeared in the satirical black comedy Heathers that same year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-29.jpg><p>Graham then appeared as Nadine in the crime drama Drugstore Cowboy, and soon after, she joined the cast of I Love You to Death with William Hurt and Keanu Reeves. She went on to play Annie Blackburn in 1992's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, and then co-starred with James Woods in the sports-comedy drama Diggstown. In 1993, Heather Graham appeared in Six Degrees of Separation, The Ballad of Little Jo, and Even Cowgirls Get the Blues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-27.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After taking a small break, she returned in 1997 with Boogie Nights, Nowhere, and Scream 2. Two Girls and a Guy and Lost in Space were released in 1998. Then came the popular 1999 film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>Who Is Meredith Duxbury From The e.l.f.

She was everywhere in the 1990s and one of the most popular actresses on the scene.</p><h2 id=heather-graham-in-the-early-2000s>Heather Graham In The Early 2000s</h2><p>Committed marked the beginning of Heather Graham's second significant decade. Her portrayal of an unhappy married woman in Sidewalks of New York came next. She worked on many major motion pictures in the early 2000s, such as Killing Me Softly, From Hell, Anger Management, Say It Isn't So, The Guru, and Hope Springs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-27.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She portrayed Dr. Molly Clock in the NBC TV series Scrubs from 2004 to 2005. Graham also made an appearance in the movie Mary and an episode of Arrested Development during this time. In the American films Bobby, Gray Matters, Adrift in Manhattan, Broken, and Miss Conception, she co-starred. She portrayed Jade in the 2009 film The Hangover. She didn't appear in the film's sequel, but she returned as Jade in the third and final installment of the trilogy, The Hangover Part III.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>The Truth About Cystic Acne, What Work's And What Doesn't</a></span></p><p>In 2009, she played the lead in the movie Boogie Woogie. She then made several less-than-successful movies, including Father of Invention, Judy Moody, 5 Days of War, and About Cherry. Graham played the title role in the televised version of the three part Lifetime series Flowers in the Attic, Petals on the Wind, and If There Be Thorns. A lot of other TV roles came her way up until 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-heather-graham-use-for-skincare>What Does Heather Graham Use For Skincare?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5-25.jpg><p>Now for the really good part! How does Heather Graham keep her face looking so youthful, dewy, and clear? Healthy skin is all about moisturizer, so it is no surprise that Heather will turn to <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">La Mer Face Cream</a></strong>, $285.00, which is ON SALE NOW for $114.99! It's still a lot for face cream, we get it, but if you ever wanted to see what it feels like to wear celebrity face cream, now is the time! This is by far the most popular brand of moisturizer among the most famous faces in Hollywood. At 60% off, treat yourself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Heather Graham also uses the other popular Hollywood gem, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Weleda Skin Food</a></strong>. Regular price: $18.50; on sale now for $14.50. A much more affordable option, and highly recommended. It is a very rich cream and can be used all over, not just the face. You can even use it in your hair to tame frizz. The all natural ingredients smell amazing and get the job done.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">The Body Shop Vitamin E Night Cream is</a></strong> $17.00. What is really important about this night cream is the vitamin E! A lot of Hollywood A-listers use some form of vitamin E, especially around the eyes, because of its nourishing properties. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vitamin E does not reduce the appearance of scars </a>like it is marketed; what it does is provide a moisturizing barrier on the skin and prevent clogs from getting packed full of pollutants that cause blackheads.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">T A T C H A luminous hydrating spray:</a></strong> $46.55. This can be used prior to putting on makeup and after as a face refresher. It gives the skin a lot of extra glow and sheen. Whenever we see Heather Graham, she looks so fresh and dewy—this is why!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Graham has also said she sleeps around 9 to 12 hours a night, which is very beneficial for her skin, as well as drinks a lot of water. We can only hope all of us have that amazing skin of hers in our 50s!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYrWVlaHqpscCtn56qXZy%2ForTApmSlp5%2BgwG6uxK2rnqpdqbWiuoyerZ6qXaW2pMDUq5ysZaOgtq%2BvwKucZquVmL%2BmwNJo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fat-53-heather-graham-looks-better-than-ever-and-we-have-the-pictures-to-prove-it.html&text=At%2053%20Heather%20Graham%20Looks%20Better%20Than%20Ever%20And%20We%20Have%20The%20Pictures%20To%20Prove%20It&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fat-53-heather-graham-looks-better-than-ever-and-we-have-the-pictures-to-prove-it.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fat-53-heather-graham-looks-better-than-ever-and-we-have-the-pictures-to-prove-it.html&title=At%2053%20Heather%20Graham%20Looks%20Better%20Than%20Ever%20And%20We%20Have%20The%20Pictures%20To%20Prove%20It" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fat-53-heather-graham-looks-better-than-ever-and-we-have-the-pictures-to-prove-it.html&title=At%2053%20Heather%20Graham%20Looks%20Better%20Than%20Ever%20And%20We%20Have%20The%20Pictures%20To%20Prove%20It" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fat-53-heather-graham-looks-better-than-ever-and-we-have-the-pictures-to-prove-it.html&title=At%2053%20Heather%20Graham%20Looks%20Better%20Than%20Ever%20And%20We%20Have%20The%20Pictures%20To%20Prove%20It" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fat-53-heather-graham-looks-better-than-ever-and-we-have-the-pictures-to-prove-it.html&description=At%2053%20Heather%20Graham%20Looks%20Better%20Than%20Ever%20And%20We%20Have%20The%20Pictures%20To%20Prove%20It" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./hoda-kotb-shares-how-ex-fiance-joel-schiffman-told-her-i-love-you.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hoda Kotb Shares How Ex-Fiance Joel Schiffman Told Her 'I Love You'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./15-huge-celebs-who-gave-up-their-dreams-and-retired-from-hollywood.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Huge Celebs Who Gave Up Their Dreams And Retired From Hollywood">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
