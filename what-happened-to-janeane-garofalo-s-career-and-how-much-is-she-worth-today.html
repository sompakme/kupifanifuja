While she only lasted on SNL for one season, she was part of a very memorable cast that included Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, David Spade, and Mike Myers. In her short time at SNL she impersonated many famous women, including Madonna, Martha Stewart, Pamela Anderson, and even First Lady Hilary Clinton. She was not fired from the famous sketch comedy series, but rather she decided to leave <a href=#>on her own terms because she was not impressed with the comedy on the show that season</a>. Fortunately for Garofalo, leaving Saturday Night Live does not seemed to have harmed her career at all.

Her first TV role was as a cast member on the short-lived sketch comedy series The Ben Stiller Show, which aired a total of thirteen episodes in the early 1990s. Garofalo appeared on all thirteen episodes of the show, and she also worked on it as a writer. The show went on to win an Emmy Award in 1993 for Outstanding Writing in a Variety or Music Program. These days, Garofalo continues to make guest appearances on sketch comedy shows. In 2014 she was featured in a sketch on Inside Amy Schumer, and in 2018 she appeared on an epiosde of Baroness von Sketch Show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stand-up-comedy><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Stand-Up Comedy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Janeane-Garafalo-Stand-Up.jpg><p>Janeane Garofalo got her big break as a stand-up comedian around the same time that she started landing film and TV roles. She began performing stand-up specials on TV in the mid 1990s, including a couple of appearances on HBO. She has released two full-length comedy specials in recent years, one called If You Will in 2010 and one called If I May in 2016.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Actress Went From Being Rejected For "Not Being Attractive," To Turning Down 'SNL'</a></span></p><h2 id=film-career><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Film Career</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Janeane-Garafalo-Reality-Bites.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Janeane Garofalo's first film appearance was in the 1991 science fiction movie Late for Dinner, in which she played a very small role as a cashier. However, her big break as a film actor came a few years later, when she played an important supporting character in the 1994 film Reality Bites. After she left SNL in 1995, Garofalo went on to star in several more popular films of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Some of these films include Wet Hot American Summer, The Cable Guy, and Romy and Michele's High School Reunion.

However, she has also undertaken numerous other creative projects. In 1999, she co-wrote a book with Ben Stiller called Feel This Book: An Essential Guide to Self-Empowerment, Spiritual Supremacy, and Sexual Satisfaction. The book, which was a humorous parody of popular self-help books, became a New York Times bestseller. She made her one and only foray into directing in 2001 when she made a short film called Housekeeping. From 2004 until 2006, Garofalo hosted a program on the Air America radio network called The Majority Report. The Majority Report is still being produced to this day, but Garofalo has long since stepped back to work on other endeavors.</p><h2 id=janeane-garofalo-39-s-net-worth-today><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Janeane Garofalo's Net Worth Today</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Janeane-Garafalo-Romy-and-Michelle.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Janeane Garofalo has a net worth of $5 million. While that is not a particularly high net worth for a successful Hollywood actor, Garofalo has clearly made enough money in her career to live comfortably. She has done many, many projects over the years, but they are often smaller productions with a niche audience, which explains why she isn't incredibly wealthy despite having played so many roles over the past thirty years.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Rolling Stone Says This Massive Movie Star Is The Worst SNL Cast Member Ever</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhko5memq6vsYygmKunlpa5sHnSmquuqpSWxm66yKCfrWWcnsOmecKaqZ6domKur7CMp5ytZaekv7W0jGtna2lf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-janeane-garofalo-s-career-and-how-much-is-she-worth-today.html&text=What%20Happened%20To%20Janeane%20Garofalo%27s%20Career%2c%20And%20How%20Much%20Is%20She%20Worth%20Today%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-janeane-garofalo-s-career-and-how-much-is-she-worth-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-janeane-garofalo-s-career-and-how-much-is-she-worth-today.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Janeane%20Garofalo%27s%20Career%2c%20And%20How%20Much%20Is%20She%20Worth%20Today%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-janeane-garofalo-s-career-and-how-much-is-she-worth-today.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Janeane%20Garofalo%27s%20Career%2c%20And%20How%20Much%20Is%20She%20Worth%20Today%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-janeane-garofalo-s-career-and-how-much-is-she-worth-today.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Janeane%20Garofalo%27s%20Career%2c%20And%20How%20Much%20Is%20She%20Worth%20Today%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-janeane-garofalo-s-career-and-how-much-is-she-worth-today.html&description=What%20Happened%20To%20Janeane%20Garofalo%27s%20Career%2c%20And%20How%20Much%20Is%20She%20Worth%20Today%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./20-memes-that-got-people-in-serious-trouble.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20 Memes That Got People In Serious Trouble">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-truth-about-katy-perry-and-russell-brand-s-divorce.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Truth About Katy Perry And Russell Brand's Divorce">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
