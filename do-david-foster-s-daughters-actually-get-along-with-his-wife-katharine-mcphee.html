Yolanda was always super sweet to David, making him dinner and showering him with love. It was a big shock to find out that they were going to get divorced. And for many fans, it was also surprising to hear that David Foster was engaged to Katharine McPhee, who is several decades younger than him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Katharine and David are now happily married and the parents to baby boy Rennie. And Katharine is now the stepmother of David's daughters: 51-year-old Allison, 48-year-old Amy, 40-year-old Sara, 39-year-old Erin, and 35-year-old Jordan. But do David's kids actually like his wife?

And it looks like David Foster's kids are totally fine with his wife Katharine McPhee... but they think that she's really attractive.</p><p>Jordan, Sara, and Erin <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commented on Katharine McPhee's appearance</a>. According to People, Erin explained, "Our biggest issue with [Katharine] is how hot she is. Her body is insane."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Erin also shared that her husband agrees that Katharine is really good-looking: "When she comes over for family Sundays, I'm like, 'Do not get in a bikini.' My husband's always like, 'Kat, get in the pool!' And I'm like, 'Simon...'"</p><p>David Foster shares the sentiment: when Katharine shared a photo holding their baby on social media, he wrote in the comments, "HOT MOM!!!!!" with a fire emoji.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sara Foster Reveals Her Dad David Foster Was Not Around When She Was Growing Up</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Erin explained to People that Katharine is a "facilitator" and if David Foster argues with his children, Katharine encourages him to call them and make up.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erin Foster talked about Katharine McPhee</a> and had nothing but sweet words to say about her stepmom. She told Us Weekly that Katharine fit in with everyone "effortlessly" and that she is "strong" because marrying someone with grown-up kids isn't ever going to be a simple task. She also noted that David was married four times before Katharine. Erin said, "we really genuinely love Katharine."</p><p>Many were surprised by the age difference between the couple since David is 72 years old and Katharine McPhee is 37.

He explained in David Foster: Off The Record, “How can I leave a sick woman? The fact of the matter is, that is not the reason why I left. It was for a different reason, which I will never disclose, but it had nothing to do with her being sick."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Katharine McPhee's Time On 'American Idol' Was Really Like</a></span></p><h2 id=sara-and-erin-foster-had-a-show-called-39-barely-famous-39>Sara And Erin Foster Had A Show Called 'Barely Famous'</h2><p>Sara and Erin Foster seem super close and they also had their own show on VH1 called Barely Famous.

Just the idiots we all know.”</p><p>The sisters have some acting credits to their names as well: most notably, Erin appeared on The O.C. and Sara played Jen Clark on the reboot of 90210.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Surprising Facts About Katharine McPhee</a></span></p><p>Katharine McPhee is also famous for her musical TV series Smash, which aired for two seasons.
