The <a href=#>rapper who has massive car collection</a> started his musical career in early 2000s which produced Power of the Dollar for Columbia Records. However, just days before the album's scheduled release, he was shot, and it was never made available to the public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Two years later, 50 Cent’s Guess Who’s Back mixtape was published and caught Eminem’s attention which made the latter sign him to Shady Records. 50 Cent has sold over 30 million records globally during his career and received numerous awards. This has accumulated him <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a net worth of $40 million</a>.&nbsp; He has become an inspiration to a lot of people and below are the 10 lessons from 50 cent in which led him to success:</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="The 8 Most Expensive Watches And Jewelry In 50 Cent's Collection" href=#>The 8 Most Expensive Watches And Jewelry In 50 Cent's Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=never-question-yourself>Never Question Yourself</h2><p>People will always give their opinions on something, but you have to remind yourself that these are mere opinions and yours is the most important among them all. Some people will try to bring you down by making you listen to the words they say, but 50 Cent would like to remind everyone that never ever question your own opinion about your own life because at the end of the day, you only got yourself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=be-the-better-version-of-yourself>Be The Better Version Of Yourself</h2><p>The versions of yourself will not be loved by anyone, and living in this world often requires us to adjust something about ourselves. When you become exposed to the real world where you have to work with different people in your field, you have to follow certain standards to help you perform your job.</p><p>The advent of <a href=#>social networking websites like Facebook</a>, which have been around for more than ten years and one of the most effective marketing aspects of these websites, didn't really take off until a few years ago. Despite their continued use as traffic-generating strategies, social media currently reigns supreme.</p><h2 id=be-authentic>Be Authentic</h2><p>This might contradict the second advice, but despite many people’s opinion, you shouldn’t change just because they told you so. The beliefs and lifestyle choices of those people surrounding you can be forced upon you in a world where everyone is uniquely made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Avoid this by being authentic; you are who you are, you are a whole different person who is different from everyone. Don't let your loved ones try to convince you that your aspirations are unattainable and that your goals are unachievable.</p><h2 id=have-faith-in-yourself>Have Faith In Yourself</h2><p>Like any successful person, 50 Cent lives by a few standards, one of which is to always have faith in oneself. He believes that it is a must for one person to have faith in their goals and exert the necessary effort and take the necessary steps to attain them.</p><p>Without this conviction, you'll find it difficult to exert the necessary effort since you'll be preoccupied with the possibility that it won't be achievable. You cannot accomplish something you don’t believe you can do.</p><h2 id=always-believe-and-keep-grinding>Always Believe And Keep Grinding</h2><p>No matter how hard you work for something you want to achieve, you cannot always get what you want in this world. Sometimes, despite your best efforts, things may still not turn out as you had hoped.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>50 Cent who owns expensive things</a> reminds everyone to not allow this to make you want to give up. Continue to put in the effort and have faith in what you're doing. In order to get closer to your goals, you will undoubtedly need two things: persistence and confidence.</p><h2 id=always-have-dedication>Always Have Dedication</h2><p>Dedication is one key to success, even 50 Cent believes it. One must dedicate their entire life to it for their dreams to come true. One must work toward their goals, and even if they haven't quite achieved them, be content with the fact that they are moving in the right direction and enhancing their own quality of life. In the words of 50 Cent, "Get rich or die trying".</p><h2 id=let-hardships-motivate-you>Let Hardships Motivate You</h2><p>Death will always be there, but you must not let it stop you from leaving your life. After being shot, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50 Cent would like to remind everyone</a> to not be afraid of death, instead make it a reminder that it might happen any moment; therefore, live your life to the fullest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=be-mindful-of-the-changes-on-your-environment>Be Mindful Of The Changes On Your Environment</h2><p>An excellent understanding of everything going on around you, including how people are behaving and feeling, events that are happening, and how things are evolving, comes from having high observational abilities. <a href=#>A lot of celebrities became entrepreneurs</a> because of their ability to adapt to their surroundings.</p><p>From a business standpoint, knowing why things are changing and how to take advantage of those changes will help you stay competitive in this world where everybody seems to be moving so fast.</p><h2 id=it-is-not-always-fun>It Is Not Always Fun</h2><p>Push yourself to be better, don’t let boredom eat you alive. Once you get through the initial stages of boredom while struggling, you'll be much happier and begin to like it much more. Practice with patience makes everything perfect.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=failure-is-not-a-total-loss>Failure Is Not A Total Loss</h2><p>Most negative events can be transformed into positive ones. When you initially fail at something, one must analyze what went wrong and how they might utilize this to their own advantage. Failure is not a total loss; rather it will give you a win by making you realize and look at the bigger picture. Failure will defeat the weak, but it will inspire the strong.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Becoming Unstoppable: Canva Co-Founder Melanie Perkins Shares Her Most Important Entrepreneurial Lessons" href=#>Becoming Unstoppable: Canva Co-Founder Melanie Perkins Shares Her Most Important Entrepreneurial Lessons</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wealthy Gorilla</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entrepreneur</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Addicted To Success</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbHSnmSaqpVignF5wp6lratdory0wIyipKmnoqmur8CMq6ylnaNiwbB50q6anJ2VmXqquoyloJ%2BdXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthese-are-50-cent-s-most-important-rules-to-succeed-in-life.html&text=These%20Are%2050%20Cent%27s%20Most%20Important%20Rules%20To%20Succeed%20In%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthese-are-50-cent-s-most-important-rules-to-succeed-in-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthese-are-50-cent-s-most-important-rules-to-succeed-in-life.html&title=These%20Are%2050%20Cent%27s%20Most%20Important%20Rules%20To%20Succeed%20In%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthese-are-50-cent-s-most-important-rules-to-succeed-in-life.html&title=These%20Are%2050%20Cent%27s%20Most%20Important%20Rules%20To%20Succeed%20In%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthese-are-50-cent-s-most-important-rules-to-succeed-in-life.html&title=These%20Are%2050%20Cent%27s%20Most%20Important%20Rules%20To%20Succeed%20In%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthese-are-50-cent-s-most-important-rules-to-succeed-in-life.html&description=These%20Are%2050%20Cent%27s%20Most%20Important%20Rules%20To%20Succeed%20In%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-sofia-richie-s-brother-miles-missed-elliot-grainge-wedding.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Sofia Richie's Brother Miles Missed Elliot Grainge Wedding">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./stranger-things-cast-from-season-1-to-now-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stranger Things Cast From Season 1 to Now: Photos">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
