Of course, they are most well-known for their efforts to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), notably Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, but they have also directed non-Marvel movies.</p><p>Based on your level of Marvel enthusiasm, this list will either make you tremendously pleased or immensely irritated that the Russo brothers' <a href=#>non-Marvel movies</a> aren't receiving the attention they deserve. Let’s take a look at the 8 highest-grossing Russo brothers’ movies of all time.</p><h2 id=the-gray-man-2022---454-023-limited-theatrical-release>The Gray Man (2022) - $454,023 (Limited Theatrical Release)</h2><p>It was intended to be a blockbuster espionage thriller, and if you remove the word thriller and replace it with a movie, that is exactly what it is. This film's pedigree is extraterrestrial: Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans, and Ana De Armas are all deserving of entry. There are explosions, jokes, and Chris Evans sporting a mustache. Everything is present on the surface, except for a good script. It is likewise difficult to predict how this film will be regarded in a few years. Will it eventually become a cult classic? Most likely not. Many critics believe that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix paid $200 million</a> for a subpar film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=welcome-to-collinwood-2002---4-5-million>Welcome To Collinwood (2002) - $4.5 Million</h2><p>The Russo brothers' debut film is probably their least well-known, but it put them on the map. This comedy heist film starring a virtual who's who of early-2000s performers combines the Russo brothers' distinctive combination of action and humor. It also shows George Clooney in a wheelchair as a grumpy safecracker. It is a remake of the Italian film Big Deal on Madonna Street from 1958 (I soliti ignoti).</p><h2 id=cherry-2021---40-million-limited-theatrical-release>Cherry (2021) - $40 Million (Limited Theatrical Release)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cherry follows Holland as a man with serious PTSD from war who robs banks to fund his drug addiction, providing Holland with an opportunity to break away from his normal superhero fare. While <a href=#>Tom Holland</a>'s performance was appreciated, critics complained that the film was a bit too conventional, resulting in a 37% Tomatometer score. The film critic for the San Jose Mercury News, Randy Myers, stated that the Russos did not precisely nail this one. Making an artistic film about the effects of war and addiction is a smart strategy, but the directors didn't quite succeed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 8 Highest-Grossing Zendaya Movies, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=you-me-and-dupree-2006---130-4-million>You, Me and Dupree (2006) - $130.4 Million</h2><p>In the mid-2000s, it was impossible to produce a movie without Owen Wilson's participation. He was in just about everything, so it's only natural that he appears in this classic whose synopsis seems to read "add Wilson to this and it'll be a hit." It sort of succeeded, as the film grossed $130 million on a $54 million budget, but neither fans nor critics were very impressed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=captain-america-the-winter-soldier-2014---714-4-million>Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) - $714.4 Million</h2><p>This is significant since it is the first <a href=#>Marvel film</a> that the Russo brothers directed. It demonstrates that superhero films can be more than just family-friendly popcorn fodder; they can be emotional, high-stakes, and written brilliantly. It is a well-told, sophisticated drama with narrative rhythms typical of a tearjerker.</p><p>The film focuses on character development rather than spectacle, although the spectacle is tremendous. It appears to be a comic book brought to life. With a 92% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, this film's reputation as one of the best Marvel films overall is supported by the opinions of many. Critics concur with this assessment, as the film's Certified Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes is 90%.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Highest-Grossing Timothée Chalamet Movies, Ranked</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=captain-america-civil-war-2016---1-153-billion>Captain America: Civil War (2016) - $1.153 Billion</h2><p>This is difficult to ignore. This was the first major MCU film following <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2012's The Avengers</a>, and it did not disappoint. Based on the norms governing superheroes, the heroes were split into two camps. Some enjoyed it, while others did not. With this one, the Russo brothers found their footing and really went for the fences. It succeeded. It is suspenseful, quick-paced, and highly entertaining. Captain America: Civil War included superheroes from throughout the MCU, and the stakes have never felt higher. It is one of the best Marvel films ever produced.</p><h2 id=avengers-infinity-war-2018---2-048-billion>Avengers: Infinity War (2018) - $2.048 Billion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Infinity War was a complete success and concluded with a cliffhanger that reverberated throughout the MCU. This film featured an all-star cast of Marvel characters and marked the conclusion of the Marvel Infinity Saga, which began with Iron Man in 2008. There is nothing truly negative to say about this (depending on how you feel about <a href=#>superhero movies</a>). It serves as a template for all subsequent films, and it's just... good.</p><h2 id=avengers-endgame-2019---2-798-billion>Avengers: Endgame (2019) - $2.798 Billion</h2><p>It is impossible to describe the impact of this movie. Avengers: Endgame was ubiquitous and the only topic of conversation. It was released just before the pandemic, so it didn't have to deal with impending theater problems, and it contained every significant Marvel superhero plotline, which it handled well. The cliffhanger that was left from the previous movie also made for some of the most compelling stakes to this day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Avengers: Endgame grossed more money in 11 days than its predecessor did in its first month of release, breaking box office records left and right. It is the second highest-grossing film of all time, behind only Avatar, which generated more money since it was re-released in China in 2021.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The MCU Story: Here's How Marvel Studios Became A $53 Billion Business</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We Got This Covered</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Statista</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMcWShoZedsrTAjKCpqKujnruoedGuqqynXZe%2FsMDHnqmsZZ2kw6qx0mapmqabmrFw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-8-highest-grossing-russo-brothers-movies-ranked.html&text=The%208%20Highest-Grossing%20Russo%20Brothers%20Movies%2c%20Ranked&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-8-highest-grossing-russo-brothers-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-8-highest-grossing-russo-brothers-movies-ranked.html&title=The%208%20Highest-Grossing%20Russo%20Brothers%20Movies%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-8-highest-grossing-russo-brothers-movies-ranked.html&title=The%208%20Highest-Grossing%20Russo%20Brothers%20Movies%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-8-highest-grossing-russo-brothers-movies-ranked.html&title=The%208%20Highest-Grossing%20Russo%20Brothers%20Movies%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-8-highest-grossing-russo-brothers-movies-ranked.html&description=The%208%20Highest-Grossing%20Russo%20Brothers%20Movies%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10-actors-from-the-last-decade-that-we-love-and-10-we-ve-had-enough-of.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Actors From The Last Decade That We Love (And 10 We've Had Enough Of)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./see-dates-and-ticket-details-here.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="See Dates And Ticket Details Here">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
