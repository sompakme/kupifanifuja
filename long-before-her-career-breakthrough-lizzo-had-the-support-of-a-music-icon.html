She's also all about empowering everyone to be more body positive. In fact, it's probably safe to say that Lizzo is an icon in her own right.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taking that into account, it's hard to imagine a time when Lizzo wasn't on the charts or finding success for herself. But everyone has to start somewhere and Lizzo is no stranger to this, although she was helped by having the backing of a particular music legend who may have helped pave the way for her success.</p><h2 id=how-did-lizzo-get-discovered>How Did Lizzo Get Discovered?</h2><p>Anyone who is wanting to get into the music industry will have long hoped for that all-important and special moment where all their hard work pays off, and they are discovered by that one important person who can help change their life for the better.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Lizzo-In-Her-Music-Video-Rumors.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In some cases, it may appear that someone has achieved their success overnight, and whilst it might look this way, it often won't have come without that person putting in a lot of hard work, sweat, blood, and tears in order to make it happen. Lizzo is certainly no stranger to this.</p><p>She spent a year of her life whilst <a href=#>trying to break into the music industry</a> living in her car as she was barely making enough to get by and was able to release her little-known first album in 2013. However, it was actually a year after this when she was discovered by none other than music icon Prince.</p><h2 id=prince-discovered-lizzo-as-she-was-starting-her-career>Prince Discovered Lizzo As She Was Starting Her Career</h2><p>Lizzo being <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discovered by Prince</a> happened by complete accident. She happened to be living in Minneapolis at the time and had featured in a documentary about the local music scene and it just so happened that Prince was watching that documentary.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Lizzo Teases Her "Biggest Thing Yet" With Raunchy Post</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He ended up seeing the star potential in Lizzo that many are able to see now and went as far as to invite her to his home and studio, Paisley Park. This wasn't just the first time that she went either, as she went quite a few times before his death in 2016.</p><h2 id=did-lizzo-record-with-prince>Did Lizzo Record With Prince?</h2><p>Many might think that Prince invited Lizzo over to Paisley Park to offer some words of advice regarding her career and getting it off the ground as at this point she was still relatively unknown, at least not on the international scale that she is now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lizzo.jpg><p>However, one of the reasons why he invited her over was because he wanted to record with her. Lizzo recorded the song 'Boytrouble' with him and did the rap on the song, as well as writing some of the lyrics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is certainly a big thing for anyone to record with Prince, let alone recording with him whilst they're still in the beginning stages of their career.</p><p>Lizzo even revealed that Prince even gave her some advice regarding the record, saying how he had told her that she should just imagine that the record is her own. She said she initially went in trying to be the perfect version of herself, but after his words of wisdom, she stopped trying to be perfect and embraced her true self.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Lizzo Use A Slur In Her Lyrics?</a></span></p><p>Due to their forming this friendship, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prince even offered to produce an album for Lizzo</a>, which has to be one of the ultimate dreams for anyone wanting to break into the music industry. However, this was never to be as Prince passed away before anything was ever able to happen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even so, she had been co-signed by Prince and this was a huge achievement for her as she had never been co-signed before, and said that she was "eternally grateful" to Prince for having that belief in her and for showing her something that she had yet to see in the music industry.</p><h2 id=lizzo-made-it-on-her-own>Lizzo Made It On Her Own</h2><p>Lizzo is one of those artists who not only encapsulates fans with her music, but she is also able to encapsulate them from her personality. While it's unfortunate that Prince wasn't able to help Lizzo break into the mainstream music realm, she did just fine on her own.</p><p>What sets Lizzo aside from many other artists is her body positivity message, which she has shown a variety of times including in her <a href=#>reality show Watch Out For The Big Grrrls</a>, a show where Lizzo was in search of her new backing dancers and embracing dancers of all shapes and sizes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Lizzos-Watch-Out-For-The-Big-Grrrls-Contestants.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With this, she has also <a href=#>spoken out about the music industry and mainstream media</a> in general and how they cater more towards those of a slimmer body shape as opposed to those who are plus-sized. She has also made it very clear that health is not about body shape and is more to do with healthy eating habits and keeping active.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Show Support For Lizzo After This Comedian Mocked Her Appearance</a></span></p><p>She is also one of the artists who have spoken openly about her mental health, including <a href=#>what she does to get her through the tough times of her depression</a>. This makes many people able to relate to her and her struggles and helps make her popular when trying to stand out among a whole load of other music icons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoba7xs5mrqiqm2LEqsDHZqeroZ6YsnA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flong-before-her-career-breakthrough-lizzo-had-the-support-of-a-music-icon.html&text=Long%20Before%20Her%20Career%20Breakthrough%2c%20Lizzo%20Had%20The%20Support%20Of%20A%20Music%20Icon&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flong-before-her-career-breakthrough-lizzo-had-the-support-of-a-music-icon.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flong-before-her-career-breakthrough-lizzo-had-the-support-of-a-music-icon.html&title=Long%20Before%20Her%20Career%20Breakthrough%2c%20Lizzo%20Had%20The%20Support%20Of%20A%20Music%20Icon" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flong-before-her-career-breakthrough-lizzo-had-the-support-of-a-music-icon.html&title=Long%20Before%20Her%20Career%20Breakthrough%2c%20Lizzo%20Had%20The%20Support%20Of%20A%20Music%20Icon" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flong-before-her-career-breakthrough-lizzo-had-the-support-of-a-music-icon.html&title=Long%20Before%20Her%20Career%20Breakthrough%2c%20Lizzo%20Had%20The%20Support%20Of%20A%20Music%20Icon" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flong-before-her-career-breakthrough-lizzo-had-the-support-of-a-music-icon.html&description=Long%20Before%20Her%20Career%20Breakthrough%2c%20Lizzo%20Had%20The%20Support%20Of%20A%20Music%20Icon" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mo-nique-lands-comedy-special-on-netflix.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mo'Nique Lands Comedy Special On Netflix">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kathleen-turner-didn-t-have-a-positive-friends-experience-but-had-a-different-opinion-of-matthew.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kathleen Turner Didn't Have A Positive 'Friends' Experience, But Had A Different Opinion Of Matthew ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
