You realize how much you love a person when that person is gone from your life. This is exactly what happened with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">warm-hearted and generous Friends</a>&nbsp;actor, Courteney Cox, and singer and songwriter, Johnny Mcdaid.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They met, liked each other, and got engaged. However, their engagement 'was on a break' when the couple parted ways for a good six months. They got back after this relatively brief break and now are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">madly in love with each other</a>. They are so much in love that they don’t even feel the need to get married. They have married each other in their hearts.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cox has her reasons for not marrying</a> right now and Johnny respects them. But this does not make them less of a couple. They share their lives, long-distance style. Courteney visits him in England often.</p><h2 id=courteney-cox-s-first-try-at-marriage><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Courteney Cox’s First Try At Marriage</span></h2><p>Courteney Cox married David Arquette in 1999. Even though both were high-profile celebrities, they did a fantastic job of keeping their private lives private. So nothing much is known about their romance or their wedding. We do know that Courteney looked exquisite on this special occasion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dealing-with-postpartum-depression><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Dealing With Postpartum Depression</span></h2><p>Courteney and David have a daughter named Coco, who was born in 2004. The on-screen Monica revealed that postpartum depression was real for her and that her <i>Friends</i>&nbsp;co-star, Jennifer Aniston, is the godmother of her daughter.</p><p>In 2010, Cox and David announced their separation, keeping most of the details secret. However, they remained to friends, as well as partners in Coquette Productions. In 2012, her wrestler/actor husband legally demanded a divorce, which finally happened in 2013.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston And Courteney Cox: Facts About Their Friendship</a></span></p><h2 id=moving-on-quickly><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Moving On Quickly</span></h2><p>The Scream&nbsp;actress left her ex-husband, David, and her friends startled when she quickly moved on with a new partner. David was also quick to find love with someone new. Cox started dating Johnny McDaid, a member of the popular band,&nbsp;Snow Patrol. She and Johnny&nbsp;decided to get engaged in 2014. However, they parted ways soon after, choosing to go in different directions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-they-part-ways><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Why Did They Part Ways?</span></h2><p>Courteney and David stated that the main reason behind their separation was a desperate need to understand themselves better. They also said that they remain good friends and share all responsibilities toward their daughter. They love one another immensely. Thanks to a commitment to stay close for their daughter, they were kind and understanding towards each other.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Photos Of David Arquette's Past (That Courteney Cox Wants Erased)</a></span></p><h2 id=david-s-secret-wedding-to-christina-mclarty><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>David's Secret Wedding To Christina McLarty</span></h2><p>David, who is now a fashion designer by profession, moved on quickly after his separation from his ex-wife, Courteney. He secretly married a freelance photographer he met in London during the filming of his rom-com, Run Fat Boy Run.&nbsp;They wedded with just a few guests around, at a private ceremony.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=courtney-s-quest-to-find-new-love><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Courtney's&nbsp;Quest To Find New Love</span></h2><p>Courteney Cox met her present boyfriend, Johnny McDaid, soon after she divorced David. She was introduced to the musician by Ed Sheeran in 2013. In 2015, they exchanged rings but broke up after a brief period of just several months. The couple stayed away from each other for months - John moved to England and she stayed in Malibu. They reunited in 2016.</p><h2 id=opposites-attract><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Opposites Attract</span></h2><p>Opposites attract and this is precisely what happened with Courteney and John. According to reliable sources, both the celebs have different personalities. Cox has a high-strung nature, in contrast to John, who is more relaxed. Probably, their very different personalities make them intrigued with each other.</p><h2 id=why-end-a-relationship-to-start-it-again><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Why End A Relationship To Start It Again?</span></h2><p>On one of her appearances on The Ellen DeGeneres Show,&nbsp;Ellen DeGeneres asked her about her strange relationship with her partner, John. The producer and director, Cox, explained the deep and interesting&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dynamics of their relationship</a>. She explained how, without seeing a future together, they are still together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-relationship-they-share-now><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Relationship They Share Now</span></h2><p>The ex Friends&nbsp;star revealed that their relationship got a boost after they got back together, post-breakup. She says that they are much better together now. In fact, according to the 55-year-old actor, the romance is better it was before they got engaged. The six months' distance from each other taught them a lot of things.</p><h2 id=coming-from-different-cultures-reuniting-for-love><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Coming From Different Cultures, Reuniting For Love</span></h2><p>Cox is from Alabama and John is from Ireland, so they come from different cultures. They have vastly different backgrounds and there is a culture clash sometimes. For instance, the American actress mentioned on Jimmy Kimmel LIVE&nbsp;that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John calls her his partner</a>, but she doesn't like calling him her partner. That's because, in Alabama, the term "partner" is used for same-sex relationships. Thus, sometimes people in her home state misunderstand her.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Facts About Courteney Cox That Friends Fans Would Be Surprised To Learn</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=working-together><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Working Together</span></h2><p>Cox is a producer and director, as previously mentioned and John, who is known for his explicit songs, worked on the soundtrack for one of her movies. According to some sources, he wrote more than three songs for her film,&nbsp;Just Before I Go.

Thus, getting approval from their ex for their next relationship is not so easy. However, David approves of Cox's new partner. This is primarily because both of them had the most decent split and wished the best of everything for each other.</p><h2 id=married-before-marriage><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Married Before Marriage</span></h2><p>As one of the most adorable couples of Hollywood, Courteney and Johnny share a beautiful relationship that is definitely going the distance. They used to love each other crazily, even before they got engaged. They say that their hearts are married to each other. They don't approve of labeling their relationship. They know that they have not loved anyone else on this planet like they love one another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=long-distance-love><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>&nbsp;Long-Distance Love</span></h2><p>McDaid, who is based out of England, has his band there. Thus, the couple is into a long-distance relationship. Cox keeps shuttling between two lives in Malibu and England. She often travels to England to meet her partner. She recently stated that travel costs her a lot, but they need to do it to make their relationship work.</p><h2 id=is-coco-the-reason-why-courteney-isn-t-marrying-yet><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Is Coco The Reason Why Courteney Isn't Marrying Yet?</span></h2><p>The only child of the ex-couple, Courteney and David, is named Coco, and she is one of the reasons why Courteney is not yet ready to tie the knot with John. Even though the teenager is hugely excited about her mother's wedding, Cox can't do it because, after the wedding, she will have to move to England. David would never let Coco move out of Malibu. That's why they need to wait for her to turn 18.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Momoa And Kit Harington: How Close Are They In Real Life?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaqK2iqbKvsdhmmqiwXZa7pXnJqJ%2BnpqliuqSwwKKbZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGLBqrnEpaCnnV8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fa-closer-look-at-their-relationship-timeline.html&text=A%20Closer%20Look%20At%20Their%20Relationship%20Timeline&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-closer-look-at-their-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-closer-look-at-their-relationship-timeline.html&title=A%20Closer%20Look%20At%20Their%20Relationship%20Timeline" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fa-closer-look-at-their-relationship-timeline.html&title=A%20Closer%20Look%20At%20Their%20Relationship%20Timeline" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fa-closer-look-at-their-relationship-timeline.html&title=A%20Closer%20Look%20At%20Their%20Relationship%20Timeline" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-closer-look-at-their-relationship-timeline.html&description=A%20Closer%20Look%20At%20Their%20Relationship%20Timeline" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./erotica-blogger-top-erotic-bloggers-and-websites.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Erotica Blogger  Top Erotic Bloggers and Websites">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./youtuber-moriah-elizabeth-s-daughter-s-name-revealed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Youtuber Moriah Elizabeths Daughters Name Revealed">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
