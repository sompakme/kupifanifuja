Taron Egerton was brought back for the sequel, and based on his salary, he definitely increased <a href=#>his impressive net worth.</a></p><p>Let's take a look at the success of Sing 2 and see how much Taron Egerton made to voice Johnny in the franchise once again.</p><h2 id=taron-egerton-is-a-fantastic-actor>Taron Egerton Is A Fantastic Actor</h2><p>At just 32 years old, Taron Egerton is a performer who has been stacking up the credits and the accolades during his time in Hollywood. It seems like it was just yesterday that the actor was making waves as the new kid on the block, but these days, he is a household name who is capable of turning heads with his acting abilities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Egerton has done a bit of everything in film and television, though it has been his work on the big screen that has earned him the most acclaim. So far, Egerton has starred in the Kingsman movies, Robin Hood, and Rocketman, which saw him take home some of the biggest awards in entertainment, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including a Golden Globe</a>.</p><p>On the small screen, the actor has worked on projects like Watership Down, Moominvalley, and The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance.</p><p>Of course, there is no way to talk about the exceptional work that Egerton has turned in without taking some time to focus on his work in the Sing franchise.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Dwayne Johnson's Film Debut Salary Broke A Guinness World Record</a></span></p><h2 id=taron-egerton-voiced-johnny-in-39-sing-39>Taron Egerton Voiced Johnny In 'Sing'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>2016's Sing was an animated release from Illumination that was looking to leave its mark on audiences. Illumination had success already, and the studio was hopeful that this film would be their next major hit. Turns out, their gamble paid off, as Sing became a sensation once it hit theaters.</p><p>Starring names like Taron Egerton, Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, and Scarlett Johansson, Sing boasted an incredible voice cast and a fantastic story, both of which contributed to its success. It got solid reviews from fans and critics, giving it excellent word-of-mouth to boost ticket sales.</p><p>At the end of its theatrical run, Sing had grossed north of $600 million, making it a genuine hit. Suddenly, Illumination had another major property on their hands, and soon enough, the ball got rolling on a sequel project.</p><p>This was great news for Egerton, who was able to tack on another hit to his resume. It also meant another solid paycheck for the performer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Harrison Ford Made A Shockingly Low Salary Of $1,000 Per Week For This Film</a></span></p><h2 id=taron-egerton-is-making-300-000-for-the-sequel>Taron Egerton Is Making $300,000 For The Sequel</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Showbiz Galore</a>, Egerton will be taking home a solid $300,000 for his second time voicing Johnny in the Sing franchise. Some might have expected this number to be a bit higher, but Egerton is part of an ensemble cast, and if the website's numbers are accurate, then no one is even cracking $1 million.</p><p>Per the site, Matthew McConaughey, who is voicing Buster Moon, will be the top-earning performer with an $800,000 salary. Other performers who come in just below him and just above Egerton include Reese Witherspoon and Scarlett Johansson, who will be making $700,000 and $550,000, respectively.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sing 2 just hit theaters back in November, and it has had a nice haul at the global box office. To date, the film has scored nearly $250 million worldwide. Of course, given everything that's going on, no one expected this to make as much as its predecessor. Well, that, and the fact that Spider-Man: No Way Home has been breaking records and effectively dominating the industry since its December release.</p><p>At this time, there is no word on a third Sing film, but considering that Sing 2 was the highest-grossing animated movie of 2021, we can see it happening. Clearly, there is interest in the property, and stars like McConaughey have already said that they would be on board for another film.</p><p>"Maybe Sing 3, but it wasnâ€™t in this one and a lot of people have been saying that and Iâ€™m like thatâ€™s right, Buster Moon should sing, whistle, diddy, hum, dance, something. Oh, thatâ€™d be super fun. That could be it. Bring it up to the director, Iâ€™m with you," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which Cast Member Of â€˜How To Get Away With Murderâ€™ Has The Highest Salary Besides Viola Davis?</a></span></p><p>Sing 2 was a success at the box office, and it's nice to see a talent like Egerton securing the bag.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>This Four-Year-Old 'Modern Family' Cast Member Was Able To Double Her Salary</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmqqfo3qms8Srq6imXai2r7OMa2SsmZyWv7p7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-will-taron-egerton-make-for-sing-2.html&text=How%20Much%20Will%20Taron%20Egerton%20Make%20For%20%27Sing%202%27%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-will-taron-egerton-make-for-sing-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-will-taron-egerton-make-for-sing-2.html&title=How%20Much%20Will%20Taron%20Egerton%20Make%20For%20%27Sing%202%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-much-will-taron-egerton-make-for-sing-2.html&title=How%20Much%20Will%20Taron%20Egerton%20Make%20For%20%27Sing%202%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-will-taron-egerton-make-for-sing-2.html&title=How%20Much%20Will%20Taron%20Egerton%20Make%20For%20%27Sing%202%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-will-taron-egerton-make-for-sing-2.html&description=How%20Much%20Will%20Taron%20Egerton%20Make%20For%20%27Sing%202%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-cook-liver-pudding.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to cook liver pudding">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-many-grammys-does-taylor-swift-have.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Many Grammys Does Taylor Swift Have?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
