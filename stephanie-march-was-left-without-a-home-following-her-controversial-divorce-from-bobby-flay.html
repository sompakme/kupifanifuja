Although the two released a statement to People announcing that "they have come to an amicable divorce settlement", sources close to the former couple implied otherwise. Also, Stephanie March was left without a home following their divorce.</p><p>According to one inside source, March had to leave the apartment in Manhattan she'd been living in with her mother, who was dealing with health issues. March was dealing with her own not long after. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The prenup provides Bobby the marital house</a>, valued at around $8 million.

"He will keep the house in Amagansett and the Manhattan apartment. Stephanie has to leave the Manhattan apartment at a specified date in the next few months. She has been staying there with her mother, who has been in poor health. It has been a very difficult time for her. It is unclear what her future living arrangement will be as she continues to care for her mother," per Page Six.</p><h2 id=bobby-flay-and-stephanie-march-reportedly-separated-due-to-rumors-of-infidelity>Bobby Flay And Stephanie March Reportedly Separated Due To Rumors Of Infidelity</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bobby-flay-and-stephanie-march.jpg><p>Although the two appeared happy together, Bobby Flay and Stephanie March went through a bitter and controversial divorce. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The two reportedly separated because Flay was unfaithful during their marriage</a>. The celebrity chef had an alleged affair with a host at his Bar Americain in Midtown. <a href=#>He was also linked to January Jones, and their alleged affair was exposed by a car crash</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>March apparently learned about the Iron Chef star's alleged three-year-long affair with host Elyse Tirrell in 2015. "[March] came into my house and was sobbing uncontrollably," her friend, Maia Madison, recounted. "She said, 'I can't believe the last ten years of my life have been a lie.'"</p><p>Madison continued, "Elyse had always seemed so nervous when Stephanie came into the restaurant, and Stephanie, not knowing what was happening, went out of her way to compliment her and try to make her feel more comfortable."</p><p>Madison added that Tirrell had been to the couple's home more than once. "Elyse had even been to Stephanie's home when she was there - and when she wasn't. Now this girl is about to become the Monica Lewinsky of the food world."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A statement released by a spokesperson for Bobby Flay, Julie Halpin, neither denied nor confirmed if he'd had an affair with Elyse Tirrell.

He and March went through a tumultuous divorce as they battled in the courts. Flay allegedly had affairs with at least three women. March wanted to change the prenup, stating she helped with Flay's work.</p><h2 id=march-and-flay-renegotiated-their-original-prenuptial-agreement>March And Flay Renegotiated Their Original Prenuptial Agreement</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/instar43013571.jpg><p>Divorces can be tough, and many <a href=#>celebrities who've gone through dramatic divorces</a> have dealt with plenty of scrutiny. After rumors surfaced of his three-year affair with Elyse Tirrell, Bobby Flay's business partner, Laurence Kretchmer, wanted to defend the chef. "I've been in the middle of this relationship for 14 years, and he did everything he could to save his marriage."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Flay obtained both houses in the divorce settlement, and ultimately forced March out of the homes she'd been living in for years, which likely left her feeling a little uncertain. She and Flay fought over money in court, with the Law and Order: SVU star claiming she'd affected Flay's work. The two reportedly renegotiated the prenup, so she would receive more than the original $5,000 a month.</p><p>"March's legal team questioned the prenup and were able to secure her a better deal than what was provided in the original agreement. It will never be as much as Stephanie deserves, but it is better than the $5,000 a month. Her friends say the more generous settlement wasn't due to Bobby's desire to do the right thing, but his fear of being exposed [as an alleged cheater]," per Page Six.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bobby-flay-s-girlfriend-christina-perez-s-instagram-reveals-what-their-relationship-is-really-like.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Bobby Flay's Girlfriend Christina Perez's Instagram Reveals What Their Relationship Is Really Like</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>What can fans learn about Bobby Flay and Christina Perez's relationship from her fun Instagram account?</span><p>Bobby Flay and Stephanie March's divorce left March without a home.
