It was a thing back then. You got some arms, you got guns or got a gun, that was a sign of brotherhood with the street.”</p><p>Jaz also spoke about Jay-Z coming to his home following the shooting to return the firearm. “He ran to my crib because you bust a gun, I don’t care who you are, you get nervous. You get nervous and you need somewhere to run to, so I guess he was like, ‘Let me run over to this ni**a’s house and drop this sh*t off for worst-case scenario.’ So he came up there and dropped it off and everything.”</p><p>According to the lyrics in “You Must Love Me,” the Brooklyn rep’s reason for shooting his brother was to prove a point to his sibling for stealing his jewelry. However, Hov’s older brother never fingered him for the shooting, allowing him to skate scot-free.</p><p>Watch the clip of Jaz-O’s interview speaking on the incident below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2Buu3nOZqGasV2veqjBzWaqoaefqXqjvs6tn56qXWZ%2FdICVbWxwbWNk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjaz-o-didn-t-know-jay-z-would-use-his-borrowed-gun-to-shoot-his-brother.html&text=Jaz-O%20Didn%27t%20Know%20Jay-Z%20Would%20Use%20His%20Borrowed%20Gun%20To%20Shoot%20His%20Brother&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjaz-o-didn-t-know-jay-z-would-use-his-borrowed-gun-to-shoot-his-brother.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjaz-o-didn-t-know-jay-z-would-use-his-borrowed-gun-to-shoot-his-brother.html&title=Jaz-O%20Didn%27t%20Know%20Jay-Z%20Would%20Use%20His%20Borrowed%20Gun%20To%20Shoot%20His%20Brother" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjaz-o-didn-t-know-jay-z-would-use-his-borrowed-gun-to-shoot-his-brother.html&title=Jaz-O%20Didn%27t%20Know%20Jay-Z%20Would%20Use%20His%20Borrowed%20Gun%20To%20Shoot%20His%20Brother" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjaz-o-didn-t-know-jay-z-would-use-his-borrowed-gun-to-shoot-his-brother.html&title=Jaz-O%20Didn%27t%20Know%20Jay-Z%20Would%20Use%20His%20Borrowed%20Gun%20To%20Shoot%20His%20Brother" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjaz-o-didn-t-know-jay-z-would-use-his-borrowed-gun-to-shoot-his-brother.html&description=Jaz-O%20Didn%27t%20Know%20Jay-Z%20Would%20Use%20His%20Borrowed%20Gun%20To%20Shoot%20His%20Brother" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./johnny-tv-john-hennigan-appears-on-6-23-aew-rampage.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Johnny TV (John Hennigan) Appears On 6/23 AEW Rampage">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./alma-kuc-wikipedia-biography-age-height-instagram-boyfriend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alma Kuc Wikipedia, Biography, Age, Height, Instagram, Boyfriend">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
