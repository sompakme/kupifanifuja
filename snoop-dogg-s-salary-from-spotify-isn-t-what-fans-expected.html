A year later, Snoop released his debut album, Doggystyle, which made it to number one on the Billboard 200! It’s no wonder why Snoop is considered one of the biggest icons of gangsta rap.</p><p>Since his debut album came out in 1993, Snoop has released 19 other studio albums and seven collaboration albums. Throughout his career, this rapper has sold over 35 million albums across the world.</p><p>He’s also very popular on streaming services, with billions of streams on Spotify alone. However, in a recent interview, Snoop Dogg revealed how much he actually makes from Spotify streams.

Snoop’s second most-streamed song is ‘Still D.R.E.’, which also has over 1.3 billion total streams. Some other of the rapper’s most popular songs on Spotify are ‘The Next Episode,’ ‘California Gurls,’ and ‘Drop It Like It’s Hot.’</p><p>Given that his songs are streamed by thousands, if not millions of people every day, it’s surprising that Snoop only made $45,000 from Spotify streams last year. But this is not new. Over the years, many small <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">artists have called out Spotify for not paying them their fair share</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>No One Knew This Rumor About Snoop Dogg Was True (Until Cameron Diaz Confirmed It)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Cameron Diaz let the cat out of the bag about Snoop Dogg during an interview. But, really, it was something fans already suspected about the rapper.</span><p>Most streaming services, including Spotify, don’t have a flat rate per stream. Instead, they use a pro-rata payment model to pay artists. In Spotify’s case, they collect all advertising and subscription revenue over a month, then share 70% (with the other 30% going directly to Spotify) with artists based on the number of streams they accrued during that month. According to Business Insider, this means that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Spotify pays artists around $0.003 and $0.005 per stream.</a></p><p>Of course, the most popular artists are able to make millions from this system. For instance, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Taylor Swift is said to have made $84K per week with only one song</a>. By being the most streamed artist of 2023, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Swift made over $100 million from Spotify streams</a> last year.</p><h2 id=snoop-dogg-still-has-an-impressive-net-worth-of-160-million>Snoop Dogg Still Has An Impressive Net Worth Of $160 Million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite not making a lot of money from Spotify, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Snoop Dogg has an impressive $160 million net worth</a>. Most of his fortune comes from his record sales and concerts, including his <a href=# rel=nofollow>performance at the Super Bowl</a>. However, Snoop has also made a good sum of money by appearing in popular movies and TV shows, as well as by hosting a cooking show alongside Martha Stewart.</p><p>Over the years, Snoop has also invested in real estate. In 2007, the rapper sold an eight-bedroom home in Claremont, California for $1.83 million, even though the house was worth $660,000 back when he bought it in 1994. In addition to this, Snoop owns a home in Diamond Bar, California, which he purchased in 199, and is said to have <a href=# rel=nofollow>bought a house on the same street as his mansion</a>, a complex he calls Tha Chuuuch.</p><p>It’s clear that Snoop Dogg won’t be running out of money any time soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqp6efpXqlu8agZKyZnJa%2FunnFq6amZaOlvLW1xbJkpaenmr9uwMeapWadqKWypMDEnWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsnoop-dogg-s-salary-from-spotify-isn-t-what-fans-expected.html&text=Snoop%20Dogg%27s%20Salary%20From%20Spotify%20Isn%27t%20What%20Fans%20Expected%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsnoop-dogg-s-salary-from-spotify-isn-t-what-fans-expected.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsnoop-dogg-s-salary-from-spotify-isn-t-what-fans-expected.html&title=Snoop%20Dogg%27s%20Salary%20From%20Spotify%20Isn%27t%20What%20Fans%20Expected%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsnoop-dogg-s-salary-from-spotify-isn-t-what-fans-expected.html&title=Snoop%20Dogg%27s%20Salary%20From%20Spotify%20Isn%27t%20What%20Fans%20Expected%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsnoop-dogg-s-salary-from-spotify-isn-t-what-fans-expected.html&title=Snoop%20Dogg%27s%20Salary%20From%20Spotify%20Isn%27t%20What%20Fans%20Expected%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsnoop-dogg-s-salary-from-spotify-isn-t-what-fans-expected.html&description=Snoop%20Dogg%27s%20Salary%20From%20Spotify%20Isn%27t%20What%20Fans%20Expected%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./taylor-swift-s-7th-album-name-more-details-revealed-in-itunes-leak.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taylor Swifts 7th Album Name, More Details Revealed in iTunes Leak">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rodolfo-jimenez-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rodolfo Jimenez Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
