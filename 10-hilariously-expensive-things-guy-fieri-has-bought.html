He is a restaurateur, author, and has even won an Emmy Award. It took years for Fieri to become a household name, but now that he is one, don't expect him to disappear anytime soon. He has cemented himself in Food Network infamy and has legions of devoted fans who obsessively follow all of his various television ventures in addition to visiting his many restaurants.</p><p>Given his success, it's not surprising Guy Fieri has amassed a million-dollar empire. So what does he choose to spend his money on? We've compiled a list of some of the most hilariously expensive items Fieri has paid for during his career.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: </span><a href=#>A Restaurant In England Accidentally Serves Customer A $5,800 Bottle Of Wine</a></p><h2 id=kulinary-gangsta>10. Kulinary Gangsta</h2><p>Guy Fieri may be known for his crazy bleached, spiky hairdo but did you know he has another notable physical attribute? On his forearm, he has a tattoo that says, "kulinary gangsta." It's just as cringe-worthy as it sounds. The tattoo is sizable, involves color, and it is an original design, meaning it cost him a pretty penny to get done.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Food Network</a>, the tattoo artist was Joe Leonard, and Fieri had this to say about why he chose to get a skull and knife added to it: "My buddy Joe Leonard does these monkey-wrench symbol tattoos and I told him, 'Change it. I want mine upside down with a chef's knife in it.'"</p><h2 id=his-entourage>9. His Entourage</h2><p>Some people don't like to travel alone, and Guy Fieri is one of those people. He prides himself on having a considerable posse to accompany him on his many trips around the world. His crew is known to get rowdy from time to time too.</p><p>One notable example occurred during an overnight stay at a hotel when one of his entourage members got drunk and damaged an elevator in addition to berating a member of the hotel's staff. Even Fieri's fame didn't prevent him and his team from getting yelled at. His crew is around 20 people in total, and they have nicknames like Machete and Gorilla.</p><h2></h2><h2 id=guy-s-american-kitchen-and-bar>7. Guy's American Kitchen and Bar</h2><p>Known for having restaurants in California, Las Vegas, and even on several cruise ships, Fieri tried to broaden his range to include a new tourist hotspot in New York City. Guy's American Kitchen and Bar was meant to be a big success along the lines of Emeril Lagasse's many restaurants, but it failed spectacularly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Tech Companies With Stocks You Could Only Dream Of Affording</a></span></p><p>On opening day, the New York Times released one of its most scathing culinary reviews in publication history, and they weren't the only ones. The immense distaste for the NYC restaurant grew into an Internet joke. Fieri later went on to claim he only sent out the recipes and wasn't in charge of any cooking, but Guy's American Kitchen and Bar closed its doors for good in January 2018.</p><h2 id=name-change>6. Name Change</h2><p>Did you know Guy Fieri's name isn't even Guy Fieri? Yep, the man we know as Fieri now used to be Guy Ramsay Ferry. He decided he didn't think Ferry was fitting enough for his crazy persona and paid to have it changed to Fieri!</p><p>While name changes aren't nearly as expensive as the other items on this list, they still can cost you a few hundred dollars depending on where you go. Plus, you have to admit it's a little hilarious that Guy Fieri actually had to come up with the name "Fieri" because he didn't think "Ferry" worked for the celebrity status he was trying to attain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=yellow-cars>5. Yellow Cars</h2><p>Everyone needs a hobby, and Guy Fieri's hobby is collecting cars. He has a passion for obtaining great American vehicles and working on them, some of them he even builds himself. But they do have one thing in common: they're all blindingly yellow.</p><p>Why yellow? He likes the color. Ironically, when he got his first dream car, a Chevy Chevelle, he hated the yellow but it grew on him, and now every car he adds to the collection is yellow too! Not only does Fieri collect cars, but he also endows them with fancy nicknames like SS Hunter, Big Bite, Full Bore, and Devil CJ.</p><h2 id=hair-bleach>4. Hair Bleach</h2><p>Chances are, when you think of Guy Fieri, the first thing that comes to mind is his bright bleach hairdo. He knows that's how people recognize him and because it has become his trademark, he has no plans on getting rid of his iconic cut and dye anytime soon.</p><p>But anyone who has ever dyed their hair knows how much upkeep it requires. Fieri's real hair is naturally brown, which means he has to get it touched up regularly. Those frosted tips don't come cheap, but they're part of his brand. Even his wife doesn't enjoy the blond and if she can't change his mind, then no one can.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pops>3. Pops</h2><p>Pops is a sulcata tortoise and Guy Fieri's family pet. He has a massive pen of his own on Fieri's property and has even broken out a few times. Pops is just as feisty as his owner. Pops also has a girlfriend of his own!</p><p>His girlfriend is a hard hat that has been in the center of his pen for years. Fieri explained to GQ that his tortoise would, "hump that hard hat. We’ll hear him. There must be a season or something, ’cos he gets goin’.” As for what he feeds his tortoise? Apparently, Pops has a taste for dog waste. Seriously.</p><h2 id=sunglasses>2. Sunglasses</h2><p>One of the essential staples of a Guy Fieri ensemble is in the eyewear, namely, the sunglasses. When was the last time you saw Guy Fieri without a pair of them? In addition to his flashy shirts, cargo pants, and flip-flops, sunglasses are a Fieri necessity. His wardrobe isn't complete without them. His favorite brand is Gatorz Eyewear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fieri wore them so often that Gatorz even designed sunglasses inspired by the famous chef. Other companies have followed suit, designing menswear with the signature chrome look so Fieri fans can try and emulate their favorite cook. As for how many he owns? The number is rumored to be well over one hundred.</p><h2 id=his-kitchen>1. His Kitchen</h2><p>It makes sense that a chef would need an immaculate kitchen to practice their recipes before debuting them to the mainstream. A chef's kitchen is basically their office. That's why Fieri decided to spare no expense when designing his home kitchen. He even added in two refrigerators, his-and-hers fridges for him and his wife.</p><p>He also has a 27,000-BTU Viking gas wok burner to ensure he never has to wait too long for a pot of water to boil. He also has a digital jukebox, foot-pedal sinks, a 20-gallon jambalaya pot, and memorabilia from his television shows.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Brands Millennials Are Killing According To Older Generations</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nla29prrSoq2eZaSdtq%2Bz0maerrFdm7amvshmmaitl53BcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-hilariously-expensive-things-guy-fieri-has-bought.html&text=10%20Hilariously%20Expensive%20Things%20Guy%20Fieri%20Has%20Bought&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-hilariously-expensive-things-guy-fieri-has-bought.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-hilariously-expensive-things-guy-fieri-has-bought.html&title=10%20Hilariously%20Expensive%20Things%20Guy%20Fieri%20Has%20Bought" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-hilariously-expensive-things-guy-fieri-has-bought.html&title=10%20Hilariously%20Expensive%20Things%20Guy%20Fieri%20Has%20Bought" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-hilariously-expensive-things-guy-fieri-has-bought.html&title=10%20Hilariously%20Expensive%20Things%20Guy%20Fieri%20Has%20Bought" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-hilariously-expensive-things-guy-fieri-has-bought.html&description=10%20Hilariously%20Expensive%20Things%20Guy%20Fieri%20Has%20Bought" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./black-panther-is-the-mcu-s-richest-superhero-by-quite-some-way.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Black Panther Is The MCU's Richest Superhero By Quite Some Way">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./why-is-jon-hamm-doing-skip-the-dishes-commercials-how-much-does-jon-hamm-make-for-mercedes-commerci.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why is Jon Hamm doing skip the dishes commercials?
