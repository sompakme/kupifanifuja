However, over time that mostly went away since things like <a href=#>Shannen Doherty's firing</a> and <a href=#>Brian Austin Green's controversies</a> caused them to leave the spotlight.</p><p>Similarly, most of the stars of the sequel series 90210 seem to have disappeared. In Shenae Grimes' case, her life has been fascinating since 90210 came to an end and she mostly stepped out of the spotlight.</p><h2 id=who-is-shenae-grimes>Who Is Shenae Grimes?</h2><p>When it was announced that Beverly Hills 90210 was getting a sequel series, fans of the original show were very excited. While the biggest thing fans wanted to know was if the original show's stars would return, there also was a lot of curiosity about what new actors would join the franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shenae-grimes-and-annalynne-mccord-when-they-were-young.jpg><p>Ultimately, Shenae Grimes and AnnaLynne McCord would become the two new stars that were most closely associated with 90210. Since most people had no idea who Grimes was before she was cast in 90210, that left them wondering about her.</p><p>Born in Toronto, Ontario, Grimes launched her professional acting career in 2004. Like many other Canadian performers before her, Grimes began her career when she was cast in Degrassi: The Next Generation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shenae-grimes-then-and-now.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hired to portray Darcy Edwards, Grimes portrayed a conservative and Christian teen. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grimes was nominated for a Best Performance in a Children's or Youth Program or Series Gemini Award</a> for her Degrassi: The Next Generation portrayal and won.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jason Priestley's Beverly Hills, 90210 Experience Was Downright Complicated, Here Are His Brutally Honest Thoughts About It</a></span></p><p>When Grimes was still starring in Degrassi: The Next Generation, her life changed forever. Ultimately, Grimes wound up <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quitting Degrassi: The Next Generation after she was cast as Anne Wilson</a>, 90210's main character.</p><p>Even though many of Beverly Hills, 90210's stars came and went, Grimes stayed with the sequel series until the end. After Grimes starred in five seasons of 90210, the show came to an end, and she was left to figure out the next chapter of her life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-shenae-grimes-since-90210-ended>What Happened To Shenae Grimes Since 90210 Ended?</h2><p>Looking at Shenae Grimes' filmography, there is no denying that she never starred in a show or movie as high profile as 90210 again. However, Grimes definitely has landed a long list of roles in the years since 90210.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shenae-grimes-wearing-a-black-dress.jpg><p>Grimes would go on to star in several TV movies, including a Hallmark Christmas movie. Some of Grimes' TV movie credits include Christmas Incorporated, When I Think of Christmas, The Hazing Secret, Date with Love, and The Mechanics of Love.</p><p>Grimes would also go on to appear in an episode of iZombie before she landed what could be the most interesting role of her post-90210 career. In 2018, Grimes starred in The Detail, a Canadian police procedural that aired on CTV. Even though The Detail only lasted for a season, it is cool that she took a very different kind of role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With her role in The Detail, Grimes' acting career took a pretty big turn. However, it is Grimes' personal life that has taken the biggest twists and turns since her time starring in 90210.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Beverly Hills 90210 Star Shannen Doherty Was Forced To Leave The Hit Show For A Different Reason Than Fans Think</a></span></p><p>An example of a twist in Shenae Grimes' personal life is the fact that she has a new name now. Since 2013, the former 90210 star's legal name has been Shenae Grimes-Beech since she walked down the aisle.</p><p>Married for a decade as of this writing, Grimes has been sharing her life with Josh Beech. An English singer and songwriter who fronts a band that goes by his last name, Beech has also worked as a model off and on throughout his life.</p><p>On top of being married for years, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grimes and Beech have also added to their family</a>. In May 2018, the couple's daughter Bowie Scarlett Beech was born followed by their son Kingsley Taylor Beech who entered the world in August 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shenae-grimes-family-photo.jpg><p>Not long after Grimes and Beech got married, the couple decided to form a business together. As Nylon reported in July 2014, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grimes and Beech started a clothing and jewelry line</a> that was branded with the name two halves at the time. While speaking to Nylon, the couple described the idea behind their business.</p><p>"The inspiration behind our branding and debut collection is the California desert, the gritty streets of South London and our love of rock and roll throughout its most iconic periods. We wanted to fulfill our dreams of creating something we felt was a true representation of us, as individuals and as two halves and we couldn't be bothered to wait for anyone else to make that happen."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for Grimes and Beech, Two Halves ultimately failed. The couple used Two Halves' Instagram account to announce <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their company was closing and everything was on sale for 60% off</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>There May Have Actually Been Even More Wild Cast Fights On The Set Of Beverly Hills 90210 Than Fans Previously Thought</a></span></p><p>Grimes' company failure was a setback for the actor, but it wasn't the only issue she ever dealt with. In 2014, Grimes got herself in the middle of a backlash when she tweeted "Biggest thanks to the supportive and patient love of my life for putting up with the long hours in b*ttf**k Hamilton! Love you my babe x"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shenae-grimes-life-and-career-changed-forever-after-she-disappeared-when-90210-was-canceled.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unsurprisingly, many residents of Hamilton were outraged by Grimes' tweet. In an attempt to address that, Grimes tweeted, "Ouch! Way to misconstrue social media and have a negative perspective. Had an awesome time shooting in the beautiful forests of Hamilton…"</p><p>Grimes later spoke to Entertainment Tonight Canada about the drama and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tried to clear things up</a>. As Grimes explained, her original tweet was referring to her filming in an area of Hamilton where there wasn't much around. Grimes never meant to insult Hamilton or the people who live there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shenae-grimes-photoshoot.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In August 2023, Grimes got wrapped up in drama once again. However, this time the drama wasn't of Grimes' own making as it was jerks on social media that started everything. After randoms on social media began insulting Grimes by saying she has aged poorly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she called them out</a>. "Thing is…I’m just… aging. I’m nearly 34 years old with 2 kids, what the hell do you expect?!"</p><p>Grimes then followed up that post with another where she showed off her body. In an Instagram video that she captioned in part "Petite punk in Paris vibe today", Grimes showed herself getting dressed and appeared on camera <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wearing nothing but a Calvin Klein underwear set</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivMSpnKecXai1prrAnmSgqpmisrR5wJ%2Brnqpdbn1zfY9mrpqrXZiur6%2FEpZydZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fshenae-grimes-life-and-career-changed-forever-after-she-disappeared-when-90210-was-canceled.html&text=Shenae%20Grimes%27%20Life%20And%20Career%20Changed%20Forever%20After%20She%20Disappeared%20When%2090210%20Was%20Canceled&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshenae-grimes-life-and-career-changed-forever-after-she-disappeared-when-90210-was-canceled.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshenae-grimes-life-and-career-changed-forever-after-she-disappeared-when-90210-was-canceled.html&title=Shenae%20Grimes%27%20Life%20And%20Career%20Changed%20Forever%20After%20She%20Disappeared%20When%2090210%20Was%20Canceled" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fshenae-grimes-life-and-career-changed-forever-after-she-disappeared-when-90210-was-canceled.html&title=Shenae%20Grimes%27%20Life%20And%20Career%20Changed%20Forever%20After%20She%20Disappeared%20When%2090210%20Was%20Canceled" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fshenae-grimes-life-and-career-changed-forever-after-she-disappeared-when-90210-was-canceled.html&title=Shenae%20Grimes%27%20Life%20And%20Career%20Changed%20Forever%20After%20She%20Disappeared%20When%2090210%20Was%20Canceled" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshenae-grimes-life-and-career-changed-forever-after-she-disappeared-when-90210-was-canceled.html&description=Shenae%20Grimes%27%20Life%20And%20Career%20Changed%20Forever%20After%20She%20Disappeared%20When%2090210%20Was%20Canceled" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-drue-and-gabe-reddit-drama-all-about-discussion-on-racist-comment.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is Drue And Gabe Reddit Drama All About?
