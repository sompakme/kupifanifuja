The British singer-songwriter has sold over 20 million records worldwide, and even people who are not into his music will probably recognize some of his greatest hits.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Did Danny Trejo Earn His $8 Million Net Worth?</a></span>Everyone knows his net worth is more than deserved, but what were the milestones in his career that allowed him to build such an impressive fortune? Hint: it was not only his music. Let's review how he got his hard-earned money, and also find out where he is now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-first-number-one-single><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>His First Number One Single</span></h2><p>Seal had been working on music for a long time before he became famous. He had been playing in pubs and bars in England for a few years before joining a local band, which allowed him to experience touring for the first time. While it wasn't successful, the band, Push, was the first step towards his decision to become a full-time musician. He ended up meeting producer Adamski, who invited him to work with him on his new album, and he ended up co-writing and performing the song "Killer". The song reached number one in the UK, putting him on the map.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-success-of-his-first-album><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Success Of His First Album</span></h2><p>After "Killer" topped the charts, it was the beginning of Seal's rise to fame. He was offered a record deal by an important British label that released his self-titled debut album in 1991. There are two versions of the album out there because the first one was rushed by the record label. Seal likes the second version better, but nevertheless, they are both amazing.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Is Heidi Klum's Husband's Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>This album was a big contributor to his current $40 million net worth. It did very well commercially and critically when it was first released, and his single "Crazy" became his first international hit, reaching number two in the UK Singles Chart and number seven on the Billboard Hot 100. He also won 3 <a href=#>Brit Awards</a> the following year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-award-winning-discography><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>His Award-Winning Discography</span></h2><p>After his first album, Seal's career was on the rise. In 1994, he released another self-titled album, known as Seal II. That record was a staggering commercial success, even receiving a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year, and singles like "Prayer for the Dying" and "Newborn Friend" did very well in the charts. The third single, "Kiss From a Rose", blew up because it was remixed and used for the soundtrack to Batman Forever. After Seal II, he released five more studio albums: Human Being (1998), Seal IV (2003), System (2007) Seal 6: Commitment (2010), and 7 (2015). While not all of them had the same level of success as the first two albums did, they were all great in their own way. Human Being, for instance, received mixed reviews, but it was still certified gold, which means it did great commercially. System, on the other hand, was his lowest-selling album, and yet it was one of his favorites. He has also released three cover albums: Soul (2008), Soul 2 (2011), and Standards (2017).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-work-in-reality-tv><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>His Work In Reality TV</span></h2><p>Aside from making music, another way Seal has built his net worth is through working as a judge and coach for TV shows. It started when he served as a judge for the 10th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers, and after that, new opportunities arose. In 2012, he was one of the vocal coaches of the Australian version of <a href=#>The Voice</a>. He loved that job and stayed for the second season. He then took a break, but returned in 2017. That same year, he accepted being a judge for season 12 of <a href=#>America's Got Talent</a>. Apparently, he took a liking to reality shows, because in 2019, he competed on <a href=#>The Masked Singer</a> as "Leopard".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-s-currently-not-touring><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He's Currently Not Touring</span></h2><p>It might be disappointing for fans to go into the Tour section on Seal's website and see that there are no upcoming concert dates, but sadly, touring doesn't seem to be on the horizon for now. Currently, Seal is more concentrated on his <a href=#>charity work</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Heidi Klum Recently Revealed About Her Marriage With Seal</a></span></p><p>Earlier this year, he performed in the 68th annual Boomtown Gala, which benefited many causes, including the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles, CASA, The Rape Foundation, Exceptional Children’s Foundation (ECF), and Team Primetime. He also auctioned off a special after-hours party on Zoom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Anytime one gets the opportunity to do something for children, then that’s obviously a good thing," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seal said about the event</a>. "It was a lot of fun. It was great."</p><h2 id=he-s-a-family-man><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He's A Family Man</span></h2><p>Nowadays, Seal is dedicating all of his attention to his family, namely <a href=#>his four kids</a>. Some readers might remember that Seal was married to supermodel <a href=#>Heidi Klum</a> for several years, and she's the mother of his children. However, after their divorce was finalized in 2014, it was challenging for the two of them to work out how to co-parent. Particularly during the pandemic, considering that Heidi lives in Germany and Seal lives in the US, there was a lot of conflict surrounding how they would split the time with the children. Eventually, though, they reached an agreement so that they could both safely spend time with them, specifying the dates each of the parents would travel during 2020 and 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It requires teamwork," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seal said earlier this year</a>. "If you are a team, if both parents are a team, then it’s really easy and that’s not a real challenge at all… But you have to be a team. And if you’re not a team, then it can all fall to pieces."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How Does The Property Brothers' Net Worth Compare To Other HGTV Stars?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbaledKemKVllZa%2Fr3mTaWSmoZyhtrC6jKecrWWnpL%2B1tIywn5qsXZ7AbrTEZpuooZ6ceq%2B71mafnqGUnnqsuNSmZKSho6h6p77OpmSaZaKkwKZ7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-did-seal-earn-his-40-million-net-worth-and-what-is-he-doing-now.html&text=How%20Did%20Seal%20Earn%20His%20%2440%20Million%20Net%20Worth%2c%20And%20What%20Is%20He%20Doing%20Now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-did-seal-earn-his-40-million-net-worth-and-what-is-he-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-seal-earn-his-40-million-net-worth-and-what-is-he-doing-now.html&title=How%20Did%20Seal%20Earn%20His%20%2440%20Million%20Net%20Worth%2c%20And%20What%20Is%20He%20Doing%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-did-seal-earn-his-40-million-net-worth-and-what-is-he-doing-now.html&title=How%20Did%20Seal%20Earn%20His%20%2440%20Million%20Net%20Worth%2c%20And%20What%20Is%20He%20Doing%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-seal-earn-his-40-million-net-worth-and-what-is-he-doing-now.html&title=How%20Did%20Seal%20Earn%20His%20%2440%20Million%20Net%20Worth%2c%20And%20What%20Is%20He%20Doing%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-did-seal-earn-his-40-million-net-worth-and-what-is-he-doing-now.html&description=How%20Did%20Seal%20Earn%20His%20%2440%20Million%20Net%20Worth%2c%20And%20What%20Is%20He%20Doing%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jodi-lyn-o-keefe-it-s-important-to-highlight-women-characters-right-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jodi Lyn O'Keefe: 'It's Important to Highlight Women' Characters Right Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dylan-nalbandian-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dylan Nalbandian Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
