To get started, users need to download the app from the Google Play Store and sign up for an account. Once registered, they can access various features and gameplay options offered by Bingo Smash.</p><p>The gameplay of Bingo Smash follows the traditional rules of Bingo, where players need to daub numbers on their cards as they are called out. The objective is to form winning patterns and earn points based on the number of daubs made. Players can join different Bingo rooms with unique themes and compete against other players in tournaments.</p><p>To enhance their gameplay and increase their chances of winning, players can use in-game coins and power-ups.
