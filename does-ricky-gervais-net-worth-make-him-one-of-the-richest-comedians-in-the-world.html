While Gervais certainly should be proud of The Office, there is a lot more to his career than that beloved sitcom.</p><p>A comedian who doesn't pull punches, Gervais isn't afraid to <a href=#>call out a talk show host like Jimmy Fallon</a> or <a href=#>debate religion with Stephen Colbert</a>. However, Gervais seems to love making money as a standup comedian the most. Thanks to his fame and success as a comedian, Gervais has become very wealthy, but how does his fortune stack up among his peers?</p><h2 id=ricky-gervais-has-an-incredible-fortune-but-several-comedians-are-richer-than-him>Ricky Gervais Has An Incredible Fortune But Several Comedians Are Richer Than Him</h2><p>From the moment that Ricky Gervais rose to fame, the comedian, actor, and creator has been outspoken. One example of that is the fact that Gervais once went on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a rant against "multi-millionaire" "celebs" who judge healthcare workers</a> who struggle to get by.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ricky-gervais-was-able-to-bank-a-fortune-thanks-to-us-syndication-rights-of-the-office.jpg><p>To Gervais' credit, it turns out that he was speaking out against his own during that rant. After all, according to Celebrity Net Worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gervais has a $160 million fortune</a> as of January 2024.</p><p>In 2009, Ricky Gervais was interviewed by Lesley Stahl for a segment that aired on 60 Minutes. During the resulting conversation, Gervais stated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was "not proud of being rich"</a> .</p><p>Given how wealthy Gervais reportedly is, he would be the richest person by far if he walked into most rooms in the world. However, while Gervais is wealthy, to say the least, that doesn't necessarily mean he is one of the richest comedians in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bill-burr-and-sarah-silverman-s-constant-bickering-resulted-in-one-of-the-cringiest-talk-show-interviews-ever-front-back_commons-licences.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Bill Burr And Sarah Silverman's Constant Bickering Resulted In One Of The Cringiest Talk Show Interviews Ever</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Bill Burr and Sarah Silverman are both comedy greats but their awkward talk show interview together was so unfunny that it was hard to watch.</span><p>On the website Celebrity Net Worth, there are pages dedicated to the majority of the most famous people in the world.

As a result, it is very easy to argue that Groening shouldn't be included in Celebrity Net Worth's list.</p><p>Just like Groening, there are other very questionable inclusions in Celebrity Net Worth's list.

Instead, Gervais would move up to the number thirteen slot. While that is impressive by any measure, it still can be argued that Gervais isn't one of the richest comedians.</p><p>For anyone who considers Gervais to be the thirteenth richest comedian, it is fascinating to see which of his peers are wealthier. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Jerry Seinfeld, Ellen DeGeneres, Jay Leno, Kevin Hart, Larry David, Adam Sandler, Bill Cosby, Dan Aykroyd, Ray Ramano, Steve Harvey, and Drew Carey are all richer than Gervais.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ricky-gervais-earned-a-huge-portion-of-his-fortune-without-doing-any-work>Ricky Gervais Earned A Huge Portion Of His Fortune Without Doing Any Work</h2><p>In the world, there are a lot of people who get rich by letting their money do the work for them.

Instead, it could easily be argued that the most fascinating thing is learning how much Gervais makes from the American version of The Office.</p><p>Even though Gervais did barely any direct work on the American version of The Office, it was based on ideas he came up with. Given that Gervais and Stephen Merchant created the original version of The Office, they clearly deserve to cash in on every adaptation. Still, it is amazing to see <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how much Gervais reportedly has made from the American version</a>.</p><p>"Gervais and his co-creator Stephen Merchant have earned tens of millions of dollars during the original run of The Office through various producer and creator credits. Ricky's true windfall has come thanks to extremely lucrative syndication and licensing deals in more recent years. Ricky owns at least 10% of The Office's syndication equity points. In other words, he earns 10% of all profits generated by the show. To date, Ricky Gervais has easily earned north of $100 million before taxes through syndication sales."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipopubrnqosdGvmKKrXaOytXnWqKmtoF2ntqS0xKyrZpuforKltcCnqmahnmLBqbGMsKarpJRk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdoes-ricky-gervais-net-worth-make-him-one-of-the-richest-comedians-in-the-world.html&text=Does%20Ricky%20Gervais%20Net%20Worth%20Make%20Him%20One%20Of%20The%20Richest%20Comedians%20In%20The%20World%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-ricky-gervais-net-worth-make-him-one-of-the-richest-comedians-in-the-world.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-ricky-gervais-net-worth-make-him-one-of-the-richest-comedians-in-the-world.html&title=Does%20Ricky%20Gervais%20Net%20Worth%20Make%20Him%20One%20Of%20The%20Richest%20Comedians%20In%20The%20World%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdoes-ricky-gervais-net-worth-make-him-one-of-the-richest-comedians-in-the-world.html&title=Does%20Ricky%20Gervais%20Net%20Worth%20Make%20Him%20One%20Of%20The%20Richest%20Comedians%20In%20The%20World%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-ricky-gervais-net-worth-make-him-one-of-the-richest-comedians-in-the-world.html&title=Does%20Ricky%20Gervais%20Net%20Worth%20Make%20Him%20One%20Of%20The%20Richest%20Comedians%20In%20The%20World%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-ricky-gervais-net-worth-make-him-one-of-the-richest-comedians-in-the-world.html&description=Does%20Ricky%20Gervais%20Net%20Worth%20Make%20Him%20One%20Of%20The%20Richest%20Comedians%20In%20The%20World%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./fans-think-cuba-gooding-jr-s-15-million-net-worth-isn-t-that-impressive.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fans Think Cuba Gooding Jr.'s $15 Million Net Worth Isn't That Impressive">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./celeste-loots-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celeste Loots Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
