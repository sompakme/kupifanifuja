While it can be difficult for regular people to find love, it’s even more difficult for celebrities because of the abundance of options available to them and the time spent apart. Some of these relationships started out as true romances that simply couldn’t work out in such a strained environment. Yet, there were a number of relationships that made the public wonder whether or not they were actually real.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it can be nice to think of love as something that is pure and true, it’s naïve to think that people wouldn’t manipulate the media or their own lives in order to stay on the top of their game. Celebrities that align themselves together get a huge amount of attention and increase their fame status exponentially. Although there are some couples that try to keep their personal lives private, there are others that go out of their way to pose for the cameras and walk arm-in-arm during red carpet events. However, flaunting their love in order to get extra publicity isn’t the only way a celebrity couple can make the most out of their relationship. Whether it’s trying to dispel damaging rumors or it’s to promote a film, there have been a number of celebrity couples that have clearly faked their “love” to try and further their professional careers. Check out our list of the 15 celebrity romances completely manufactured by Hollywood and see if you’ve been fooled a time or two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-justin-bieber-and-selena-gomez><strong>15. Justin Bieber And Selena Gomez</strong></h2><p>Just when millions of young girls everywhere were becoming “Beliebers,” <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a> was trying to distinguish herself from all the other Disney kids of her time. What better way to amp up her fame status than by aligning herself with the hottest new heartthrob pop star? Gomez already had a history of becoming extra chummy with anyone that was favored by the public, whether it was <a href=#>Demi Lovato</a> or <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>. Both of their public relations teams were working overtime when this “relationship” began making its way onto every tabloid headline and red carpet event. Bieber had started out as a young pop singer with the Teen Bop hairstyle and it only helped his public persona that let him start to be seen as a little more mature. Yet, just as Bieber started spinning out of control, their “relationship” came to an end. However, anytime things get a little slow in their careers, they both make sure to bring up each other’s names as quickly as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-taylor-swift-and-tom-hiddleston><strong>14. Taylor Swift And Tom Hiddleston</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> had already gained a reputation for jumping in and out of relationships prior to being linked to <a href=#>Tom Hiddleston</a> but this union was more than just a little bit strange. Her past relationships with <a href=#>Harry Styles</a> and <a href=#>Patrick Schwarzenegger</a> were definitely documented by the paparazzi but there wasn’t a huge spectacle made out of their poses and pictures. Yet, when she became romantically involved with Tom Hiddleston, it seemed like an actual show that the two were putting on specifically for the cameras. In one instance, Hiddleston romped on the beach with Swift wearing an “I Heart T.S.” shirt and another occasion showed the two posing for a couple’s photo. <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds</a> and <a href=#>Blake Lively</a> are also in the photo and Reynolds has a look on his face that speaks a thousand words. The Hiddleston relationship was over as quickly as it started and it left people wondering if the whole thing was just manufactured to gain publicity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-kylie-jenner-and-tyga><strong>13. Kylie Jenner And Tyga</strong></h2><p>There’s no secret that <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a> obviously sees a role model in her big sister, Kim Kardashian. While Kylie was once thought of as the baby-faced younger sister that stayed out of the limelight in comparison to her supermodel sister, <a href=#>Kendall</a>, she quickly turned that around by following the same path Kim Kardashian took at the start of her “career.” Kylie underwent a huge transformation in the looks department, with before-and-after photos showing everything from butt injections to a serious lip job. Yet, the kicker was her opportunistic new boyfriend, <a href=#>Tyga</a>. Photos of the two conjure up instant references to Kim Kardashian’s relationship with <a href=#>Ray J</a> when she was first trying to get famous and people are left wondering when Kylie and Tyga’s inevitable sex tape will be leaked/released.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-rob-kardashian-and-blac-chyna><strong>12. Rob Kardashian And Blac Chyna</strong></h2><p>There has always been a bit of insecurity on the part of Rob Kardashian, especially since he was often thought of as the least successful Kardashian sibling. While his sisters were out getting multimillion dollar endorsement deals, Rob was actually getting an allowance from <a href=#>Khloe</a> while living with her and her husband. Rob’s insecurities often led to him lashing out at his sisters, especially Kim. Yet, this may have been because he wanted fame and success all on his own. This came as soon as he became romantically involved with Blac Chyna because the two had a tumultuous relationship that led to a baby and, of course, their own reality series. It’s hard to claim this as a real romance since there is actually already a family connection due to her baby’s father, Tyga, dating Rob’s sister, Kylie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-vanessa-hudgens-and-zac-efron><strong>11. Vanessa Hudgens And Zac Efron</strong></h2><p>The most difficult part about gaining fame at a young age is how hard it can be to make the public see you as more than just an up-and-comer. Many celebrities have found this awkward stage before reaching adulthood extra challenging and not everyone managed it in a gradual process. When <a href=#>Zac Efron</a> and <a href=#>Vanessa Hudgens</a> first gained their mainstream fame through the High School Musical franchise, they ran the risk of being typecast in their careers and have it end before it ever made it to the big screen. Yet, if they combined their star power, they would not only get more publicity as a couple but they might be able to create enough intrigue to help them get more mature roles. This definitely worked out since Hudgens was able to add her name to the list of other young actresses in Spring Breakers and Efron was deemed a full-fledged heartthrob actor in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-tom-cruise-and-katie-holmes><strong>10. &nbsp;Tom Cruise And Katie Holmes</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Tom Cruise</a> had been fighting homosexual rumors for years prior to his romantic relationship with <a href=#>Katie Holmes</a> and there were also a lot of chatter behind-the-scenes during his 11-year marriage to <a href=#>Nicole Kidman</a>. With his marriage to Kidman being suspect, Cruise would need to do something to truly convince the public about his true love for Katie Holmes. This came in the form of Cruise appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show and jumping around like a fool on her couch in declaration for his “love” for Holmes. Once the two were married in 2006, it was already starting to look manufactured, especially when you add Scientology into the mix. Suri’s birth was more like just an extension to their immense fame and it started looking like a brand rather than a family. When Holmes filed for divorce, it was more like the closing of a business deal rather than two people that supposedly once loved each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-robert-pattinson-and-kristen-stewart><strong>9. &nbsp;Robert Pattinson And Kristen Stewart</strong></h2><p>The relationship between <a href=#>Robert Pattinson</a> and <a href=#>Kristen Stewart</a> was not unlike so many other Hollywood romances that spawn from playing love interests on the big screen. The media loves to claim that two leading actresses are actually having a secret romance behind-the-scenes because it is a great gossip piece and it also drives interest about the film. Stewart and Pattinson were first rumored to be in a romantic relationship during the filming of the first Twilight film and this continued throughout the franchise. After trying to keep things private for quite some time, all of a sudden the couple was being quite open with their relationship and walking the red carpets together to show off their love. Yet, that turned out horribly after Stewart’s cheating scandal and wasn’t exactly all real. In an interview with <a href=#>New York Times</a>’ style magazine, Stewart stated, “People wanted me and Rob to be together so badly that our relationship was made into a product. It wasn’t real life anymore.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-ryan-seacrest-and-julianne-hough><strong>8. &nbsp;Ryan Seacrest And Julianne Hough</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Ryan Seacrest</a> made a name for himself as the over-the-top host on the reality singing series, American Idol, but there was always a bit of talk in the background about his lack of a personal life. He seemed to have a million different jobs, from his television appearances to his radio show. This was used as just one of the excuses as to why he had never been married and didn’t have a girlfriend. <a href=#>Julianne Hough</a>, on the other hand, was trying desperately to make a name for herself beyond the dancing professional that hardly got to speak on Dancing with the Stars. Hough was trying to become a full-on celebrity and started on her acting career. The only other way to amplify her celebrity status was by dating someone that seemed like a notorious bachelor. The relationship really worked out for the two of them in regards to their fame status and Hough even made an awkward appearance on American Idol.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-john-travolta-and-kelly-preston><strong>7. &nbsp;John Travolta&nbsp;And Kelly Preston</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kelly Preston</a> didn’t exactly start out with a squeaky clean reputation when it came to her romances, especially since she was once linked to <a href=#>Charlie Sheen</a> and there was a very public fiasco that made it into tabloid headlines. Yet, she didn’t give up on the hope that she would become Hollywood royalty in some way. When she married <a href=#>John Travolta</a>, there were already a number of homosexual rumors surrounding him. Throughout their marriage, the rumors persisted but many just pushed them out of their minds due to the “happy” family the two stars had made with each other. Yet, it was impossible to ignore the allegations from the number of “masseuse” statements about sexual interactions with the Grease star on various occasions over the years. It’s hard to see this as anything but a fabricated relationship with so much going on behind-the-scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-shailene-woodley-and-theo-james><strong>6. &nbsp;Shailene Woodley And Theo James</strong></h2><p>Another couple that Hollywood tried to shove down the throats of moviegoers was <a href=#>Shailene Woodley</a> and Theo James from the Divergent franchise. The film series was hugely popular with audiences and it wasn’t long before the media began whispering about how believable their onscreen chemistry was and whether or not there was a real relationship going on behind-the-scenes. This was the same way the “relationship” between Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson began when the pair starred in the Twilight saga. The interesting thing about Woodley and James is that they both recognize the fact that aligning themselves with each other would actually be favorable to both of their careers. Yet, this is a relationship that doesn’t really seem like it’s real. The pair are never caught by the paparazzi coming out of restaurants are hotspots but they like to dance around whether or not they have a personal relationship outside of filming together. In fact, they have consistently gushed about each other in interviews in order to continue the speculation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban><strong>5. &nbsp;Nicole Kidman And Keith Urban</strong></h2><p>During the 11-year marriage with Tom Cruise, there were a number of rumors surrounding the sexuality of both Cruise and Kidman. Many rumors claimed that the two actors were using each other as a front to cover up their homosexuality and when the pair ultimately divorced, people wondered what would become of the Australian beauty. Tom Cruise seemed to be going down a spiral of very public snafus in his personal life and Kidman surely didn’t want to go down that same path. Instead, she aligned herself with the country singer, <a href=#>Keith Urban</a>, and the two of them went on a love campaign to “prove” their love to the world. From appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show together to Urban writing songs and dedications to Kidman, it seemed like their marriage was more like a sideshow than an actual romance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-kim-kardashian-and-kris-humphries><strong>4. &nbsp;Kim Kardashian And Kris Humphries</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> went through a string of public lovers in front of the public eye and there was starting to be a desperate need to see her settle down and have her “happily ever after” moment. Her Keeping Up with the Kardashians reality show needed a bit of a boost, especially after the viewers saw her run through a number of failed relationships. When <a href=#>Kris Humphries</a> was first introduced into her life, people were already starting to become suspicious on whether or not Kim could ever love anyone as much as herself. There were huge red flags before the pair finally said their vows but they went through with it anyways. The series would never miss out on airing her wedding and definitely couldn’t miss all of the drama regarding the demise of their 72-day marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-spencer-pratt-and-heidi-montag><strong>3. &nbsp;Spencer Pratt And Heidi Montag</strong></h2><p>When <a href=#>Lauren Conrad</a> and <a href=#>Kristin Cavallari</a> became huge reality stars from their roles on Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County and The Hills, it was more than the audience that sat back drooling over their celebrity status and luxurious lifestyle. At the time, the world of reality TV was making these ultra-young characters household names with a sizable bank account. Conrad’s friend, <a href=#>Heidi Montag</a>, quickly tried to make a name for herself by trying to become the new “It” girl and replacing Lauren Conrad in the fame game. In order to create a storyline for the series, Montag’s boyfriend, <a href=#>Spencer Pratt</a>, became a huge part of the show. From feuds to fistfights, there was always something to keep the audience talking about Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt. The couple tried to milk as much out of their relationship as humanly possible during and after The Hills concluded.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-britney-spears-and-justin-timberlake><strong>2. &nbsp;Britney Spears And Justin Timberlake</strong></h2><p>When <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> was being claimed the “Princess of Pop,” <a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a> was trying desperately to be seen as a superstar solo artist away from his former boy band. He hadn’t exactly solidified himself as a potential superstar from his Ramen noodle hairstyle or his strange decisions in fashion choices. Yet, aligning himself with the sexiest pop star in the world was a way to make his own star rise a little bit higher. Once their relationship concluded, Timberlake made sure to throw Spears under the bus as often as possible in order to promote his new album as a solo artist. In fact, it seemed like whenever Timberlake had a new project to promote or a new album released, he made sure to bring up his past relationship with Spears.</p><h2 id=1-emma-stone-and-andrew-garfield><strong>1. &nbsp;Emma Stone And Andrew Garfield</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Emma Stone</a> and <a href=#>Andrew Garfield</a> began dating when they starred in The Amazing Spider-Man film series and it helped to add to the success of the franchise. No one knew how audiences would feel about Spider-Man having a different film series from the former franchise involving <a href=#>Tobey Maguire</a>. The romance between this new Spider-Man and Emma Stone was something to get people talking about the films and give themselves their own amount of publicity. Once filming was all wrapped up, the two went their separate ways but then all of a sudden they sparked it up again when they were both promoting their Oscar-nominated films.
