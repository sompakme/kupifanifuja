For instance, there was <a href=#>Chaz Lamar Shepherd who played Raymond ‘Piranha’ Jones on Luke Cage</a>.</p><p>And of course, there was Rachael Taylor who played Trish Walker, Jessica Jones’ adopted sister.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Krysten Ritter Really Feels About Marvel</a></span></p><p>As fans may recall, Taylor went on to portray the character throughout Jessica Jones, The Defenders, and Luke Cage (she was only credited for her voice though). The actress also remained on Jessica Jones until its final season in 2019.</p><p>Since then, it doesn’t seem like Taylor has been up to much. That said, it appears that she’s made quite a fortune for herself since becoming a Marvel star.</p><h2 id=rachael-taylor-has-had-extensive-tv-experience-long-before-jessica-jones>Rachael Taylor Has Had Extensive TV Experience Long Before Jessica Jones</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even before getting cast in Jessica Jones, Taylor had already booked a number of gigs for television.</p><p>She starred in ABC’s TV remake of Charlie’s Angels alongside Minka Kelly and Annie Ilonzeh. Around the same time, Taylor also booked a guest role on the hit medical drama Grey’s Anatomy during its seventh season.</p><p>On the show, the Australian actress played Dr. Lucy Fields. Taylor soon became a fan favorite on the show, and many wondered how frequently she could appear since she was also working on Charlie’s Angels.</p><p>Early on though, Grey’s Anatomy creator, Shonda Rhimes, made it clear that fans could expect to see her again. “We only really lose her for two episodes,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told TVLine</a>. “She’s contractually obligated to us for the rest of the season, so she’s coming back when she’s done [with Angels], for our last two episodes.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rhimes also later confessed, “I would love to keep Rachael Taylor forever.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Was Krysten Ritter's Life Like Before Landing 'Jessica Jones'?</a></span></p><p>And while even Rhimes herself had high hopes for Charlie’s Angels, things didn’t quite work out for the show.</p><p>In fact, ABC decided to cancel it after just eight episodes. Following this, Taylor confessed that she knew Charlie’s Angels would get axed soon.</p><p>“It was not very good,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told The Age</a>. “I love the studio, I love Drew Barrymore, I love the girls, I loved the costumes, I loved the idea of revamping it - but for whatever the strange alchemy that film and television is, that pot just wouldn't bubble.”</p><p>Shortly after Charlie’s Angels, Taylor also got cast in the fantasy horror series 666 Park Avenue. She also later joined the cast of NBC’s action drama Crisis. Both series wrapped up their run after just one season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately for Taylor, she also booked her Marvel role for Netflix around this time.</p><h2 id=rachael-taylor-has-also-done-several-films-in-her-career>Rachael Taylor Has Also Done Several Films In Her Career</h2><p>Aside from taking on series work, Taylor had also been busy with feature films. In fact, the Australian actress made her Hollywood debut in Michael Bay’s Transformers where she played code breaker Maggie Madsen.</p><p>Recalling her audition for the film, Taylor said Bay and his team operated under a veil of secrecy. “Because it's such a pop culture phenomenon in a way, they didn't release the script, so essentially when you're auditioning you're working just off of sight. You have no idea what the story is or what the character is or where it goes,” she told Girl.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“So I didn't actually read the script until the fourth audition at which you have to sign a confidentiality agreement and you go and sit in a room and it's just a complete lockdown.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Was Lauren Ridloff Before Becoming An MCU Star?</a></span></p><p>Following her Transformers role, Taylor also booked the lead part in the horror mystery Shutter opposite Joshua Jackson. The actress followed this up with a supporting role in the crime drama Deception, which stars Hugh Jackman, Michelle Williams, and Ewan McGregor.</p><p>Taylor also went on to star in other films, such as Cedar Boys, Splinterheads, Ghost Machine, Summer Coda, and Red Dog. She continued to star in other movies while working on various Marvel series.</p><p>These include the crime thriller Finding Steve McQueen with Oscar winner Forest Whitaker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=here-rsquo-s-rachael-taylor-rsquo-s-net-worth-since-jessica-jones>Here’s Rachael Taylor’s Net Worth Since Jessica Jones</h2><p>Following her time on Jessica Jones (and the other Marvel shows on Netflix), estimates put Taylor’s net worth at $4 million. That's a bit lower than <a href=#>her co-star Krysten Ritter's net worth</a>, but it's nothing to scoff at!</p><p>Aside from taking massive earnings from her TV and film work, the actress also secured major endorsement deals, including one with skincare brand Neutrogena.</p><p>“I'm a long-standing fan of the brand so it was a natural fit,” Taylor told Beauty Directory of their partnership. “I'm passionate about good skin and products that deliver real results. And I'm very invested in facilitating conversations about empowering women to achieve their dreams.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a brand ambassador, she helped launch Neutrogena products and took part in the brand’s See What’s Possible campaign. At the moment, fans will just have to wait and see what’s next for Taylor.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here's How Marvel Really Feels About Netflix</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipmpuYlrKtedOasKWnomK7psCMsKarrJhit6a%2F0qKammWapLumv44%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-truth-about-rachael-taylor-s-net-worth-since-jessica-jones.html&text=The%20Truth%20About%20Rachael%20Taylor%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Since%20%27Jessica%20Jones%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-truth-about-rachael-taylor-s-net-worth-since-jessica-jones.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-rachael-taylor-s-net-worth-since-jessica-jones.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Rachael%20Taylor%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Since%20%27Jessica%20Jones%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-truth-about-rachael-taylor-s-net-worth-since-jessica-jones.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Rachael%20Taylor%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Since%20%27Jessica%20Jones%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-rachael-taylor-s-net-worth-since-jessica-jones.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Rachael%20Taylor%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Since%20%27Jessica%20Jones%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-truth-about-rachael-taylor-s-net-worth-since-jessica-jones.html&description=The%20Truth%20About%20Rachael%20Taylor%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Since%20%27Jessica%20Jones%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tiger-woods-ex-wife-elin-nordegren-keeps-her-relationship-with-her-much-younger-baby-daddy-jordan.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tiger Woods' Ex-Wife Elin Nordegren Keeps Her Relationship With Her Much Younger Baby Daddy, Jordan ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-154th-open-at-royal-birkdale.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 154th Open at Royal Birkdale">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
