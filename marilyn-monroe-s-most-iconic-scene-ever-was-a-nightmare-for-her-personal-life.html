Several close to the couple mentioned DiMaggio's jealousy of Monroe, even before Monroe's flying dress scene in The Seven Year Itch. When she filmed one of her most iconic scenes, an angry DiMaggio left the set.

The simple dress she wore for the scene became one of her most iconic dresses; many wear it when imitating the Hollywood legend.</p><p>Still an icon today, her famous "flying dress scene" is one film lovers and Monroe's fans are familiar with. However, some might not be aware of the consequences the scene had on her private life.</p><p>Throughout the Niagara actor's marriage to Joe DiMaggio, he reportedly struggled with Monroe's fame, wanting to control her and her career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to some, a crowd of thousands showed up to watch Monroe film the iconic white halter dress scene. But watching as onlookers cheered, and yelled, "Higher! Higher!" as the paparazzi took photos, it apparently became too much for DiMaggio, who was also there. The baseball star was clearly upset, and according to Showbiz CheatSheet, "DiMaggio's face, rigid with tension, had gone white."</p><p>When Monroe shot the scene walking over the vent, in which air from the subway causes her white dress to fly up, the crowd which had gathered went wild. Plenty of fans and paparazzi were thrilled to watch the star film the scene, but not her husband. "He was left irate as she reshot the scene over and over in front of the crowd that was cat-calling her".</p><p>Monroe recalled that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the legendary shot had been the end to her marriage with DiMaggio</a>, "he said '....exposing my legs and thighs, even my crotch - that was the last straw.'" Billy Wilder wrote in his biography, "He didn't like what he saw, or what everyone else was seeing," per Nicki Swift.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/What-Marilyn-Monroes-Most-Iconic-House-Actually-Reveals-About-The-Star.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Years After Her Death, Marilyn Monroe's House Was Discovered To Be Unsafe Due To A Secret Uncovered By A Contractor">Years After Her Death, Marilyn Monroe's House Was Discovered To Be Unsafe Due To A Secret Uncovered By A Contractor</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Years after Marilyn Monroe's tragic death, the homeowners made a disturbing discovery in the star's home.</p><p>The couple reportedly fought violently after Monroe shot the scene, and the morning after she had filmed one of the most iconic moments in cinematic history, Monroe was said by some to have bruises on her. She filed for divorce from DiMaggio shortly afterward, claiming "mental abuse".
