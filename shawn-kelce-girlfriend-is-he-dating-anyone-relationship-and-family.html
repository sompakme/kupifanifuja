Travis Michael Kelce is a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL).&nbsp;The Chiefs selected him in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft, and he went on to assist the club win Super Bowls LIV and LVII. He played college football at the University of Cincinnati. Kelce, an eight-time Pro Bowler and four-time first-team All-Pro selection is widely considered as one of the best tight ends of all time.</p><p>With seven seasons, he holds the NFL record for the most seasons with 1,000 receiving yards by a tight end.<br>Travis is incredibly famous and well-known among football fans, thus many have always been interested in his personal life. When they found that Travis had another elder brother called Shawn after Jason, they were eager to learn more about their oldest sibling, particularly his love life. As a consequence, we’re providing you with this piece about Shawn Kelce’s girlfriend and family.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shawn-kelce-girlfriend-is-travis-kelces-elder-brother-married></span>Shawn Kelce Girlfriend: Is Travis Kelce’s Elder Brother Married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The NFL world just recently learned that Travis and Jason have a sibling called Shawn. It seems that the oldest kid in the family is also the most amusing.&nbsp;Shawn Kelce claims to have his own podcast called “Kelcecast,” despite the fact that nothing is known about him.&nbsp;He just shared a hilarious video on the difficulties he has as the Kelce sibling with the lowest popularity.</p><p>Because so little is known about Travis Kelce’s brother, it’s difficult to tell whether Shawn is currently seeing anybody.&nbsp;Shawn is a reserved guy, therefore little is known about his partner and relationships. Nonetheless, we hope that fans will be able to meet Shawn’s sweetheart in the following days.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shawn-kelces-family-and-ethnicity></span>Shawn Kelce’s Family And Ethnicity<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Ed and Donna Kelce</strong> welcomed Shawn Kelce into the world in Westlake, Ohio. He grew up in a very loving and supportive family. Shawn and his parents are of American descent and of mixed race due to English-Polish-Scottish background.&nbsp;Shawn is also a loving and compassionate brother to Jason and Travis Kelce, in addition to being a fantastic son.</p><p>However, it wasn’t until recently that Jason and Travis’s older brother, Shawn, was revealed. Many people were surprised by this revelation, and they learned that the Kelce family is skilled at maintaining secrets.&nbsp;Nonetheless, being the oldest of three siblings, Shawn is quite pleased with his brothers’ worldwide success. While Travis is a football tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League, Jason is a football center for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League.&nbsp;Overall, the Kelce family of five seems to live a happy and wealthy life together, and we wish them all the best in the future days.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=travis-kelce-and-shawn-kelce-net-worth-in-2023></span>Travis Kelce and Shawn Kelce Net Worth in 2023<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Travis Kelce is estimated to have a remarkable net worth of $20 million and a salary of roughly $14 million as of 2023, according to Media Referee.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Shawn’s net worth has yet to be determined owing to his lack of recognition and media attention. Nonetheless, based on his abilities in the podcast and other sources of revenue, he may be worth millions.</p><p>Furthermore, Travis may have far higher earnings than Shawn, but with hard work and fame, his devotion may quickly close the earnings difference.&nbsp;During the media coverage of their mother, she also mentioned her elder son, Shawn, and stated her wish for him to pursue his potential with zeal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKuYlsSvecqeo5ydXZy2s7jFq6CeppRitrR5x55knZmknruoecCnsKimlWK%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF5wKebZp6RoratxY4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fshawn-kelce-girlfriend-is-he-dating-anyone-relationship-and-family.html&text=Shawn%20Kelce%20Girlfriend%3a%20Is%20He%20Dating%20Anyone%3f%20Relationship%20And%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshawn-kelce-girlfriend-is-he-dating-anyone-relationship-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshawn-kelce-girlfriend-is-he-dating-anyone-relationship-and-family.html&title=Shawn%20Kelce%20Girlfriend%3a%20Is%20He%20Dating%20Anyone%3f%20Relationship%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fshawn-kelce-girlfriend-is-he-dating-anyone-relationship-and-family.html&title=Shawn%20Kelce%20Girlfriend%3a%20Is%20He%20Dating%20Anyone%3f%20Relationship%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fshawn-kelce-girlfriend-is-he-dating-anyone-relationship-and-family.html&title=Shawn%20Kelce%20Girlfriend%3a%20Is%20He%20Dating%20Anyone%3f%20Relationship%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshawn-kelce-girlfriend-is-he-dating-anyone-relationship-and-family.html&description=Shawn%20Kelce%20Girlfriend%3a%20Is%20He%20Dating%20Anyone%3f%20Relationship%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-8-most-expensive-hollywood-lawsuits-of-2022.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 8 Most Expensive Hollywood Lawsuits Of 2022">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nordstrom-best-bathing-suits-separates-for-every-body-shape.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nordstrom: Best Bathing Suits, Separates for Every Body Shape">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
