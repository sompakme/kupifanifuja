Similarly, Jimmy Butler parents abandoned him when he was a minor, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise for him.&nbsp;</p><p>A life without parents is like standing out in scorching heat with no means of protecting yourself, but Butler did not succumb to his fate.</p><p>He rose above the challenges given to him and made a name for himself in a highly competitive field.&nbsp;</p><p>Miami Heat’s Jimmy Butler is a six-time NBA All-Star, a five-time All-NBA Team honoree, a five-time NBA All-Defensive Second Team honoree, and an Olympic Gold Medalist.&nbsp;</p><p>His countless awards and accolades are a testament to his exceptional skills and immeasurable dedication to the sport.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, the Boston Celtics became the target of Butler’s phenomenal technique and the Miami Heat’s powerful performance.</p><p>The Heat, who initially looked outmatched at TD Garden on Wednesday night, reassembled in the second half and pushed hard to win Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals.&nbsp;</p><p>Butler scored 35 points and helped lead the Miami Heat to a massive 46-point third-quarter performance before claiming the 123-116 win in Boston against their home team.&nbsp;</p><p>46 is the most points scored in any quarter in Heat’s postseason history. Butler added 7 assists, 5 rebounds and a playoff-career-high 6 steals in the Miami Heat’s recent victory.&nbsp;</p><p>The win against the Boston Celtics has allowed the Miami Heat to reach the conference finals.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, the Heat looked concrete in their sixth straight Game 1 win. Their current position is way better than what the majority expected of them.&nbsp;</p><p>Their postseason position was not too great, but they proved all wrong with their back to back victories.&nbsp;</p><p>All those who are successful today have someone to thank for their guidance and role in their life.&nbsp;</p><p>What was Jimmy Butler’s parents’ role in his life? Let’s find out!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A glance at Jimmy Butler parents role in his life</h2><p>Jimmy Butler II and Londa Butler parted ways while their son was an infant. It’s not known if they ever tied the knot, but even if they did, they chose to walk away from each other more than three decades ago.&nbsp;</p><p>Butler’s fans and admirers have always remained invested in his personal life, especially regarding his parents’ role and part in his successful career.&nbsp;</p><p>Every milestone that Butler achieves gives rise to more and more questions regarding his family life.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, the speculation that Jimmy Butler grew up as a homeless kid ignited a chain of rumors and scandals regarding his brought up.&nbsp;</p><p>The NBA Star’s father, Jimmy Butler II, belonged to an African-American ethnic background. Aside from the fact that he was born in the United States of America, none of his personal details have been revealed to the public.&nbsp;</p><p>His age, place of birth, profession, and physical stature, all remains hidden from the public.&nbsp;</p><p>Assuming Jimmy Butler III’s father was from Houston, Texas, since that’s where the Miami Heat star grew up and was born.</p><p>Although those who discovered it claim its veracity, Jimmy Butler has never confirmed it himself.</p><p>At this time, what remains known to everyone is the fact that Butler’s father abandoned his wife, Londa, and their only infant son many years ago.</p><p>Consequently, Jimmy grew up without a father figure and became who he is today without any guidance from an authoritative male figure.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, some unidentified sources proclaimed that the six-time NBA All-Star is on amicable terms with his father.&nbsp;</p><p>Only Butler himself can authenticate this rumor since it’s an extremely personal matter of his.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Michael Jordan Jimmy Butler’s father?</h2><p>Since not much is known about Miami Heat legend’s father, some people carelessly presumed that <a href=#>business</a> tycoon and former NBA player Michael Jordan is Butler’s biological father.&nbsp;</p><p>The similarity between Jordan and Butler’s playing technique and body language further validates this claim.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, this baseless rumor doesn’t end there. To establish an authentic tie between the Charlotte Hornets chairperson and Miami Heat’s power forward, some geniuses claimed that Butler is Jordan’s illegitimate child with a mystery woman.&nbsp;</p><p>According to these sources, Jordan’s affair with an unidentified woman resulted in the birth of Jimmy Butler before he got married to his wife, Juanita Vanoy.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, since having a child out of wedlock would have hit Jordan’s reputation significantly, he allegedly paid the mystery woman to keep her from sharing the news of Jimmy Butler’s birth.&nbsp;</p><p>The response to this idiotic rumor has been both, funny, and serious. Most of the people in the NBA community have joked about it, but there were some individuals who took it a bit too seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>No matter the response of the people, there is no solid evidence to support this futile claim.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Jimmy Butler’s mom?</h2><p>Just like his father, there’s not much known about Jimmy Butler’s mom. Apart from her African-American ethnicity and name, the public doesn’t know much about her.&nbsp;</p><p>As per sources, she was born and brought up in Tomball, Texas. Reportedly, she studied to become a medical office receptionist at Lone Star.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, she worked as a receptionist for a little while and later became a certified caregiver.&nbsp;</p><p>Her profession entails assisting elderly people or patients who are suffering from incapacitating or debilitating diseases.&nbsp;</p><p>From infancy till teenage, Jimmy Butler mom cared for him. When the NBA star turned 13 years old, his mother, Londa Butler, allegedly kicked him out of their house.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason behind this rash is not known to date. Maybe it was an attempt by Londa to make her son independent, or maybe she just couldn’t keep bearing his living expenses.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite having the toughest childhood, Jimmy Butler has emerged to be one of the most prominent and talented players in the National Basketball Association.&nbsp;</p><p>Butler’s exceptional career is proof that if you are determined to achieve something, you will get it no matter how hard is the path leading to it.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC2yKaksmWSqsGtsdFmp5qqlaPBtHs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjimmy-butler-parents-a-tale-of-abandonment-its-consequences.html&text=Jimmy%20Butler%20Parents%3a%20A%20Tale%20Of%20Abandonment%20%26amp%3b%20Its%20Consequences&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjimmy-butler-parents-a-tale-of-abandonment-its-consequences.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjimmy-butler-parents-a-tale-of-abandonment-its-consequences.html&title=Jimmy%20Butler%20Parents%3a%20A%20Tale%20Of%20Abandonment%20%26amp%3b%20Its%20Consequences" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjimmy-butler-parents-a-tale-of-abandonment-its-consequences.html&title=Jimmy%20Butler%20Parents%3a%20A%20Tale%20Of%20Abandonment%20%26amp%3b%20Its%20Consequences" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjimmy-butler-parents-a-tale-of-abandonment-its-consequences.html&title=Jimmy%20Butler%20Parents%3a%20A%20Tale%20Of%20Abandonment%20%26amp%3b%20Its%20Consequences" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjimmy-butler-parents-a-tale-of-abandonment-its-consequences.html&description=Jimmy%20Butler%20Parents%3a%20A%20Tale%20Of%20Abandonment%20%26amp%3b%20Its%20Consequences" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./josh-krajcik-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Josh Krajcik Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./did-katy-perry-refuse-to-speak-to-russell-brand-ever-again-following-their-scandalous-divorce.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Katy Perry Refuse To Speak To Russell Brand Ever Again Following Their Scandalous Divorce?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
