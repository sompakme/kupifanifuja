It was Howard Stern's wife, <strong>Beth, who accidentally spilled the beans.</strong> During segments before and after the wedding of Stern's youngest daughter, Ashley,<strong> Beth claimed that her step-grandchild was the flower girl</strong>.</p><p>The first time she mentioned Naomi, who was born to Stern's middle daughter, Deborah, the radio legend was clearly unhappy. So much so that <strong>he originally had the replay of the broadcast edited so that Naomi's name wasn't included.</strong> But over time, he himself has spoken about his relationship with Naomi, who lives with his daughter's family across the country.</p><p>Stern has been less cagey about the June 2024 birth of his grandson, who is the product of Ashley and her husband, Adam Weinstein.</p><p>"A couple of days ago, I became a grandfather for the second time. I have a granddaughter and a grandson... My couple runneth over."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On his June 17th, 2024 show, Howard Stern claimed that he never imagined that he'd have grandchildren. When he was younger, he envisioned having children, but nothing ever beyond that. Yet, he's been able to build a strong relationship with his granddaughter, Naomi.</p><ul><li>Howard Stern originally didn't know what he wanted his grandchildren to call him. While he claimed his wife, Beth, wasn't thrilled with being called 'grandma', <strong>Stern decided to be called 'grandpa'.</strong></li></ul><p>Howard Stern doesn't get to see Naomi as much as he'd like but has shared that they get along really well. In fact, Stern is often taken aback by their close connection. While Naomi is still very young, Stern says he entertains her by singing and doing puppet shows with her -- something he used to do himself as a child.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/did-joe-biden-s-press-team-feed-him-answers-during-his-howard-stern-interview1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Howard Stern Finally Reveals Whether Joe Biden Was Fed Answers Via An Earpiece During Their Interview">Howard Stern Finally Reveals Whether Joe Biden Was Fed Answers Via An Earpiece During Their Interview</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>President Joe Biden's critics accuse him of being fed answers during his Howard Stern interview, but the radio host sets the record straight.</p><p>Naomi also loves spending time with all of the adopted cats and rabbits that populate all three of Howard Stern's properties.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Beth Stern runs Beth's Furry Friends</strong></a> out of the North Shore Animal League.

He did so in June 2024 during a discussion about his weekend activities. Without a doubt, <strong>Stern seemed elated to have a baby grandson </strong>despite the fact he, admittedly, <strong>doesn't know how to deal with babies.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Stern's candidness was likely because his grandson was born to Ashley Jade</strong>. Ashley has been far more comfortable with her personal life being talked about on The Howard Stern Show in contrast with her two sisters. After all, she let her father and stepmother publicly discuss the events of <strong>her June 2023 wedding to Adam Weinstein</strong> in detail. Deborah, on the other hand, likes her privacy and her former shock jock father respects that.</p><p>Ashley Jade is Howard Stern's youngest daughter. She married Adam Weinstein in June 2023.

"Then I went back the next day because I couldn't get enough. It was so much fun. I really enjoyed that. He was just great."</p><p>"This [grandchild] will be closer, so you can see him more often," Quivers said to her colleague, referring to the fact that <strong>Stern's middle daughter lives in California with his other grandchild, Naomi.</strong></p><p>Following Stern's hospital visit, he participated in a North Shore Animal League gala. Because of this, he refused to return to visit his grandson despite his daughter requesting his presence. This is because Stern's still very much afraid of COVID-19 due to his germaphobia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-1-1-640x400.jpg><p>On his radio show, Stern claimed that he didn't want to give his newborn grandson anything if he picked it up from being around so many people. While he would argue that he was being considerate, others would call him "crazy". Especially since his daughter <a href=#>Ashley forced him to get over his crippling disease in time for her wedding</a> in June 2023.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tt_bachelor-joey-graziadei-s-financial-problems-expose-a-bigger-problem-with-the-show-according-to-superfan-howard-stern_061824_2160x1080px.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="'Bachelor' Joey Graziadei's Financial Problems Expose A Bigger Problem With The Show, According To Superfan Howard Stern">'Bachelor' Joey Graziadei's Financial Problems Expose A Bigger Problem With The Show, According To Superfan Howard Stern</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Joey Graziadei's money problems reveal a huge problem with The Bachelor, according to Howard Stern.</p><p>But Stern's refusal to return to visit his grandson right away may also have to do with his difficulty relating to babies. While speaking to Robin Quivers,<strong> Stern joked that his days of taking care of babies are over.</strong> Stern can spend hours with his toddler granddaughter but finds communicating with babies far more challenging. He even joked that he wanted them to watch John Wick and Godzilla Minus One together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I can't take care of little babies. I'm good for two hours. I sat there. I held him and rocked him."</p><p>A week after the birth of his grandson, <strong>Stern revealed the details of the briss.</strong> In the Jewish ethno-religion, a briss is the circumcision ceremony that is typically for the family and close friends. Stern stated that their briss was a small family affair that included his ex-wife, Alison Berns. The radio legend also worried that his grandson's 'calm disposition' would be disturbed by the ceremony. Fortunately, the urologist who did it was fast and supportive.</p><p>Given how transparent Howard Stern has suddenly become about his grandchildren, it appears his fans will learn far more about them in the coming years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK%2BRp7Fuv9OeqadllJbCqLTTnqmsZZenrq%2BwwqGgpZyimrtuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhoward-stern-s-grandchildren-are-revealed-after-keeping-their-identities-a-secret-for-years.html&text=Howard%20Stern%27s%20Grandchildren%20Are%20Revealed%20After%20Keeping%20Their%20Identities%20A%20Secret%20For%20Years&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhoward-stern-s-grandchildren-are-revealed-after-keeping-their-identities-a-secret-for-years.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhoward-stern-s-grandchildren-are-revealed-after-keeping-their-identities-a-secret-for-years.html&title=Howard%20Stern%27s%20Grandchildren%20Are%20Revealed%20After%20Keeping%20Their%20Identities%20A%20Secret%20For%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhoward-stern-s-grandchildren-are-revealed-after-keeping-their-identities-a-secret-for-years.html&title=Howard%20Stern%27s%20Grandchildren%20Are%20Revealed%20After%20Keeping%20Their%20Identities%20A%20Secret%20For%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhoward-stern-s-grandchildren-are-revealed-after-keeping-their-identities-a-secret-for-years.html&title=Howard%20Stern%27s%20Grandchildren%20Are%20Revealed%20After%20Keeping%20Their%20Identities%20A%20Secret%20For%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhoward-stern-s-grandchildren-are-revealed-after-keeping-their-identities-a-secret-for-years.html&description=Howard%20Stern%27s%20Grandchildren%20Are%20Revealed%20After%20Keeping%20Their%20Identities%20A%20Secret%20For%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jane-the-virgin-cast-where-are-they-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jane The Virgin Cast: Where Are They Now?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-much-money-does-tyran-ty-ty-smith-make-latest-tyran-ty-ty-smith-net-worth-income-sa.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Tyran Ty-Ty Smith Make?
