For lovers of the book series or the film series, it's impossible not to fall head over heels for the stellar cast that brought it to the big screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Things Few People Know About Shailene Woodley</a></span></p><p>Of course, the first flick came out back in 2014, and these young actors have certainly made impressive careers for themselves since. Whether fans of this series love Shailene Woodley's portrayal of Tris or can't get enough of Theo James, it's time to stack them up. Here is the cast of&nbsp;Divergent&nbsp;now, ranked by net worth (according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>).</p><h2 id=theo-james---unknown><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Theo James - Unknown</span></h2><p>Apparently, this heartthrob is just as mysterious as Four as he is in real life. He's been acting for years, and while he's had prominent roles, he only has a handful of credits to his name.</p><p>On top of that, he's a model for Hugo Boss, so that definitely has to rake in some dough. However, sources place this man's net worth anywhere from $6 million to $40 million, so there's no real way of knowing for sure. Whatever it is, he's definitely doing alright.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zo-kravitz---8-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Zoë Kravitz - $8 Million</span></h2><p>Kravitz is the daughter of music legend, Lenny Kravitz, but she's certainly made her own career for herself. This series was actually probably the biggest thing she had done at the time, but since then, she's been in&nbsp;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&nbsp;and has a starring role (alongside Shailene Woodley) in&nbsp;Big Little Lies.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Richest Nickelodeon Stars, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>On top of that, she's <a href=#>set to be Batwoman</a> in the newest adaptation starring Robert Pattinson. Clearly, this talented actress has far from reached the cap of her net worth.</p><h2 id=octavia-spencer--12-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Octavia Spencer- $12 Million</span></h2><p><a href=#>This Oscar-winning</a> actress might actually have a lower net worth than die-hard fans of her might have anticipated. With over 130 acting credits to her name, everyone knows her face, but she is usually on the sidelines.</p><p>She plays Johanna in this series, but she's also starred in popular films and television series for years and years. She had already made it big before this series, so it's hard to really stack her against the rest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ansel-elgort---12-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Ansel Elgort - $12 Million</span></h2><p>Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley have a similar net worth, and that's kind of fitting since their two biggest movies <a href=#>were shared together</a>. These two starred in&nbsp;Divergent&nbsp;the same year they stormed into popularity with&nbsp;The Fault in Our Stars.</p><p>Since then, Elgort has actually dabbled in creating a music career for himself! Of course, he's also the lead in&nbsp;Baby Driver&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Goldfinch.&nbsp;He also has more to come, for sure.</p><h2 id=shailene-woodley---12-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Shailene Woodley - $12 Million</span></h2><p>While she might be one of the most popular on the list, Shailene Woodley's net worth is still pretty modest. From starring in two of the biggest movies of 2014 to having a leading role in the hit HBO series,&nbsp;Big Little Lies,&nbsp;this actress has proven her talent and versatility.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Gossip Girl: The Cast Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>In fact, she has five films currently in production, so this is far from the last fans of Beatrice Prior will see of this young, bold, and talented actress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miles-teller---14-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Miles Teller - $14 Million</span></h2><p>Teller is certainly a heartthrob of today, and fans will probably remember his breakout role back in 2011 for&nbsp;Footloose.&nbsp;He also starred in a romance drama with Shailene Woodley in 2013!</p><p>However, this teen series was just the beginning for him. Since them, he was in Oscar-winning flick&nbsp;Whiplash&nbsp;and took on more mature roles like&nbsp;War Dogs&nbsp;and&nbsp;Bleed For This.&nbsp;Plus, he'll be playing Rooster in the new&nbsp;Top Gun&nbsp;flick.</p><h2 id=ashley-judd---22-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Ashley Judd - $22 Million</span></h2><p>Ashley Judd is definitely a familiar face, and she's been acting since the early '90s. A huge actress in the 1990s, she has certainly made a career for herself way before she was Natalie in&nbsp;Divergent.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>We've Ranked Saturday Night Live's Most Popular Cast Members, By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>With two Golden Globe nominations, it's no surprise she's ranked so high on this list. However, most of her fame definitely peaked a couple of decades ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=naomi-watts---30-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Naomi Watts - $30 Million</span></h2><p>This two-time Oscar nominee might just be one of the most <a href=#>popular actresses from the 2000s</a>. From&nbsp;Mulholland Drive&nbsp;to&nbsp;King Kong, she's certainly a household name in Hollywood, and it's no surprise she takes third on this list.</p><p>She plays Evelyn, Four's mom, in this series, but it was far from her claim to the big screen. Since then, she's had her share of popular flicks, and she has five more in production.</p><h2 id=jeff-daniels---45-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jeff Daniels - $45 Million</span></h2><p>Jeff Daniels is a four-time Golden Globe nominee, and fans definitely know him from&nbsp;The Squid and the Whale,&nbsp;The Martian,&nbsp;and more. Of course, fans of this franchise, though, know him best as David.</p><p>He only appeared in the last installment of this series, but that's enough for fans to remember him. Plus, he comes in second with an impressive $45 million net worth.</p><h2 id=kate-winslet---65-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kate Winslet - $65 Million</span></h2><p>It's probably not shocking to anyone that Kate Winslet takes the top slot on this list. She famously played the villain, Jeanine, in this franchise, but this was far from her initial claim to fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This Oscar-winning actress stole everyone's hearts way back in the '90s, most famously for <a href=#>portraying Rose</a> in&nbsp;Titanic.&nbsp;She lent her talent to his teen drama series, but it's certainly only a small part of her 60 acting credits.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Cast Of The Star Wars Sequel Trilogy Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiboq6Vp7SmutNmmpqrpGK7psCMsKarrJhiwLavwp6qrGc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdivergent-which-actor-has-made-it-the-biggest-ranked-by-net-worth.html&text=Divergent%3a%20Which%20Actor%20Has%20Made%20It%20The%20Biggest%2c%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdivergent-which-actor-has-made-it-the-biggest-ranked-by-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdivergent-which-actor-has-made-it-the-biggest-ranked-by-net-worth.html&title=Divergent%3a%20Which%20Actor%20Has%20Made%20It%20The%20Biggest%2c%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdivergent-which-actor-has-made-it-the-biggest-ranked-by-net-worth.html&title=Divergent%3a%20Which%20Actor%20Has%20Made%20It%20The%20Biggest%2c%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdivergent-which-actor-has-made-it-the-biggest-ranked-by-net-worth.html&title=Divergent%3a%20Which%20Actor%20Has%20Made%20It%20The%20Biggest%2c%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdivergent-which-actor-has-made-it-the-biggest-ranked-by-net-worth.html&description=Divergent%3a%20Which%20Actor%20Has%20Made%20It%20The%20Biggest%2c%20Ranked%20By%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./erin-olash-age-height-bio-boyfriend-wiki-net-worth-measurements-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Erin Olash Age, Height, Bio, Boyfriend, Wiki, Net Worth, Measurements Facts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./did-abduction-ruin-taylor-lautner-s-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did 'Abduction' Ruin Taylor Lautner's Career?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
