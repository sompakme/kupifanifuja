However, he’ll always be best remembered for his role as Chandler Bing in the beloved sitcom <strong><a href=#>Friends</a></strong>. Throughout the show’s ten seasons, Perry stole the hearts of viewers with his wholesome and charismatic personality.</p><p>During its ten-year run, only two Friends episodes were banned from TV. An <a href=#>episode featuring Perry and Matt LeBlanc was banned in the UK</a> for being considered too explicit. Another episode of Friends was banned in many countries back in the 90s because it featured a same-sex wedding.

However, he couldn’t audition because he was already tied to this other project.</p><p>“There was this part that was perfect for me and it was making me crazy that I couldn't go up for it because [of] the baggage handlers show,” he explained. “I was losing my mind.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, an executive at Fox watched the LAX 2194 pilot, which he called “the worst thing we've ever seen in our lives,” and the project was canceled. Perry recalled that the executive said, “He is available.

During an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with the bookstore Indigo</a> to promote his memoir, Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir, the actor revealed that he’d always loved the season 1 episode “The One With The Blackout” for a rather heartwarming reason.</p><p>“My favorite Friends episode was in the first season – it’s like episode six. We did an episode that was during a blackout in New York City, and I was stuck in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre and very excited about that – and then the other five actors were doing really, really funny things in Monica and Rachel’s apartment,” Perry explained.</p><p>“That was when I first realized that everybody on this show was great – and that every episode was sort of like a mini-movie. It was that well-written, well-directed, and acted. Just one of the greatest experiences of my life.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqyknbK4ec%2BeqauxXZeur7rEnWSfqpmau6W%2FjKyrq6GgYrCtwcFmqq2noq65qrrEaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-friends-storyline-matthew-perry-stepped-in-and-banned-from-the-show.html&text=The%20Friends%20Storyline%20Matthew%20Perry%20Stepped%20In%20And%20Banned%20From%20The%20Show&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-friends-storyline-matthew-perry-stepped-in-and-banned-from-the-show.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-friends-storyline-matthew-perry-stepped-in-and-banned-from-the-show.html&title=The%20Friends%20Storyline%20Matthew%20Perry%20Stepped%20In%20And%20Banned%20From%20The%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-friends-storyline-matthew-perry-stepped-in-and-banned-from-the-show.html&title=The%20Friends%20Storyline%20Matthew%20Perry%20Stepped%20In%20And%20Banned%20From%20The%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-friends-storyline-matthew-perry-stepped-in-and-banned-from-the-show.html&title=The%20Friends%20Storyline%20Matthew%20Perry%20Stepped%20In%20And%20Banned%20From%20The%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-friends-storyline-matthew-perry-stepped-in-and-banned-from-the-show.html&description=The%20Friends%20Storyline%20Matthew%20Perry%20Stepped%20In%20And%20Banned%20From%20The%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tiktok-star-emily-mariko-engaged-to-boyfriend-matt-age-difference-explored.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="TikTok Star Emily Mariko Engaged To Boyfriend Matt, Age Difference Explored">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./seaworld-vs-the-zoo-15-images-that-ll-break-your-heart.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="SeaWorld vs. The Zoo: 15 Images That'll Break Your Heart">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
