She's not only held onto her money during her tenure with the rest of the Garden State hellraisers but has parlayed some of her earnings into business ventures that have resulted in her <a href=#>personal value&nbsp;estimating at&nbsp;roughly $5 million</a>.</p><p>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Guidos Of Jersey Shore: Where Are They Now?</a></p><p>Snooki's also been among the more frugal of her Jersey Shore colleagues, unlike the frequently broke and once-jailed Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino. Still, Snooki, now married with three children, has made a few crazy purchases ever since she discovered fame. Here's a few of them.</p><h2 id=polizzi-palace>Polizzi Palace</h2><p>Once a Jersey girl, always a Jersey girl, which is why Snooki's all nicely set up in her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$2.6 million World Domination Headquarters</a> just outside Newark. It's a castle that she and husband&nbsp;Jionni LaValle built from scratch and sporting more than 4,000 square feet of luxury that includes four bedrooms and four-and-a-half bathrooms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Naturally, her favorite space in her abode is the walk-in closet, which she says is considerably bigger than some of the rooms in the place. It would have to be. That's where she stores her wardrobe, bag, jewelry, and all things Snooki. Yep, there's a lot in those confines.</p><h2 id=custom-couch>Custom couch</h2><p>Snooki made sure all the furniture would bring out the best of her pricey home, which included splurging on a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">custom-designed couch</a> valued at $10,000 once it was complete. Bad move. It's considerably worth a lot less now, given that she underestimated how active <a href=#>her kids</a> would be around the home.</p><p>Stains and spots are everywhere on the fabric, as the couch is now a monument to the more laborious aspects of motherhood. She claims she'll get it cleaned up once her kids grow older, but if she decides to resell it, who knows how much it'll go for once potential customers find out her name's behind that piece of furniture?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-big-on-bags>She's big on bags</h2><p>There's one item that vaults Snooki into shopping mode every time, and it's high-end handbags. She's got a collection of those big-name accessories like a few from Burberry, Gucci, Michael Kors, and Louis Vuitton, one of which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">goes for around $2,000</a>. She even bought a Vuitton for her mother.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#>&nbsp;Gucci: 10 Of The Most Expensive Items It Has Ever Made, Ranked</a></span></p><p>However, some of those bags were given to her back in her early <a href=#>Jersey Shore</a> days, when Snooki was determined by fashionistas to be too trashy to be considered a bona fide celebrity. Apparently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a Gucci was delivered to her free</a> by a handbag competitor with hopes that the brand would be devalued on name association alone.</p><p>Obviously, that didn't work out too well, given Snooki's status these days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gems-galore>Gems galore</h2><p>Snooki tends to wear jewelry from her company's line of accessories, but occasionally she'll put on something shiny by other designers. Her glitziest splurge that she'll admit to was on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">three opulent bracelets</a> with a collective value of about $5,000, but otherwise, she's relatively more frugal.</p><p>The lion's share of her jewelry comes from more affordable lines like Aldo and Forever 21. To save even more, she orders her wares online, handy considering the risks of being mobbed while buying them in person.</p><h2 id=classy-caddy>Classy Caddy</h2><p>For someone who lived fast on the screen, she's never owned <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a set of wheels</a> to match that pace on the road.&nbsp;Throughout much of the six-season run of Jersey Shore, she got around in a 1994 Honda Accord, a car that frequently broke down. Once the Honda bit the dust, she bought a 2011 Fiat Multipla which she crashed shortly after. That's when she opted for a more opulent&nbsp; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2011 BMW 328i Coupe</a>, which had a reported <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sticker price of $39,000</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her biggest automotive splurge to date was a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2011 Cadillac Escalade EXT</a>, which, fully loaded, set her back about $85,000. But she managed to get a decent return of more than $77,000 on the glitzy SUV when she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sold it on eBay</a>.</p><h2 id=rovin-around>Rovin' around</h2><p>A&nbsp;hookup with Jionni LaValle in the third season of Jersey Shore&nbsp;got serious to the point where they already had a kid&nbsp;on the way by 2013.&nbsp;To her, that meant that the Escalade wasn't going to be particularly child-friendly.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Most Expensive Luxury Cars Ever Sold At Auction</a></span></p><p>That's when she dumped the SUV and bought a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2012 Land Rover LR4</a>, a rock-solid vehicle with a wide range of off-road capabilities. But to prove motherhood wasn't going to take an edge off her spirited reputation, the 375-horsepower V8 engine backed up that claim handily. Fully loaded, Snooki's Land Rover cost around $68,000.</p><h2 id=shoes-made-for-walkin-and-gawkin>Shoes made for walkin' and gawkin'</h2><p>For the Carrie Bradshaw that lurks in every female celebrity, Snooki has a craving for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shoes</a>, with several pairs taking up space in her walk-in closet. And while she probably won't think twice about buying a pair of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pumps for a grand</a>, it's uncertain how many of those she owns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A lot of what she&nbsp;slips into costs closer to the $200 range, like the clunky heels courtesy of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">UNIF</a>, and some flashy stilettos similar to what <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Diane Von Furstenberg and Madden Girl</a> churn out.</p><p>But as for the price range of the custom, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">jewel-encrusted footwear</a> she wore to her wedding, let's start the range at stratospheric and work our way up.</p><h2 id=wedding-wow-factors>Wedding wow factors</h2><p>Besides those shoes, her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2014 wedding</a> was one that had her dressed to the nines with a skyrocketing budget to match. The ceremony took place at a church frequented by hubby LaValle's family before the grand Gatsby-themed bash packed some 500 guests into the spacious and luxurious Venetian hall.</p><p>She exchanged vows in an ivory&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eve of Milady Amalia Carrara&nbsp;wedding gown</a> before slipping into a&nbsp;Noir by Lazaro&nbsp;party dress for the reception. Add up all the catering and naturally the drinks that flowed through the night and that's one glitzy union.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wedding costs weren't made public, but we can start the guesswork at $100,000 and work our way up.</p><h2 id=partying-with-polizzi>Partying with Polizzi</h2><p>Let's just start with congratulating Snooki for getting off the sauce in the later seasons of Jersey Shore when she discovered she was pregnant. But before that, she proved she could swill with the best of them, especially during the show's initial episodes.&nbsp;Cast carousing got so out of control, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MTV refused to foot the bill</a> for their bar tabs in the show's second season when they were on location in Miami.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Ways Reality TV Is Lying to You</a></span></p><p>Bar managers have commented that $400 bar tabs were common with Jersey Shore binges, so Snooki's contribution is speculative. If each cast member took turns clearing a tab each night for a year, Snooki would have put in at least $20,000. And if she had continued drinking throughout the series, that tally would have&nbsp;surpassed&nbsp;$120,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sometimes,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reality TV</a> math can be fun.</p><h2 id=ok-let-s-call-them-toys>OK, let's call them toys</h2><p>Even when unattached, Snooki had enough celebrity clout to land any dude she wanted, which makes the assessment of this entry awkward at best.&nbsp;When showing off her mansion, she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted she had an assortment</a> of ummm... toys that she keeps in a drawer.</p><p>What she&nbsp;owns and their value isn't widely known, but her penchant for certain devices is no secret to Snooki fans. One Jersey Shore episode had Snooki and her gal-pals scoping out a store called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Babeland</a>, where their inventory items can&nbsp;run as high as $300. And then there's&nbsp;her cosplay wardrobe like the Dorothy outfit, a la Wizard of Oz, an amorous reminder that the <a href=#>Jersey Shore</a> star's&nbsp;not in Kansas.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Ridiculously Expensive Things The Cast Of Jersey Shore Has Bought</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nla29prrSoq2eZZqav7Sx2GaqoaeimsBuv82opqShXZe8trPHrWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-ridiculously-expensive-things-that-jersey-shore-s-snooki-has-bought.html&text=10%20Ridiculously%20Expensive%20Things%20That%20Jersey%20Shore%27s%20Snooki%20Has%20Bought&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-ridiculously-expensive-things-that-jersey-shore-s-snooki-has-bought.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-ridiculously-expensive-things-that-jersey-shore-s-snooki-has-bought.html&title=10%20Ridiculously%20Expensive%20Things%20That%20Jersey%20Shore%27s%20Snooki%20Has%20Bought" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-ridiculously-expensive-things-that-jersey-shore-s-snooki-has-bought.html&title=10%20Ridiculously%20Expensive%20Things%20That%20Jersey%20Shore%27s%20Snooki%20Has%20Bought" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-ridiculously-expensive-things-that-jersey-shore-s-snooki-has-bought.html&title=10%20Ridiculously%20Expensive%20Things%20That%20Jersey%20Shore%27s%20Snooki%20Has%20Bought" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-ridiculously-expensive-things-that-jersey-shore-s-snooki-has-bought.html&description=10%20Ridiculously%20Expensive%20Things%20That%20Jersey%20Shore%27s%20Snooki%20Has%20Bought" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-of-the-most-hated-hotels-in-the-world.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Of The Most Hated Hotels In the World ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-jason-licht-s-wife-blair-licht-and-who-are-their-children.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Jason Lichts Wife Blair Licht And Who Are Their Children?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
