She was releasing new music, performing in Las Vegas, and raising her two sons. Her love life was often in the news, as people are always interested in who famous people are dating, and nothing seemed that worrisome. Today, things are different as she has been placed under a conservatorship and she doesn't seem to be doing very well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi Lovato isn't friends with every celeb</a> but she does have some people she considers great pals. Is Britney Spears one of them? Let's take a look at whether these two singers are close.</p><h2 id=close-friends-in-the-past>Close Friends In The Past</h2><p>While there isn't any evidence of the pop singers hanging out these days or in recent years, since Britney Spears has been at home and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans think someone else is in her Instagram posts</a>, Spears and Demi Lovato seemed to be close friends back in 2012 and 2013.</p><p>Lovato shared that she was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"comfortable" around Spears</a>. According to&nbsp;MTV.com, the two met when they were judges on the reality series&nbsp;The X Factor&nbsp;and Lovato said, "I had moments where I was so comfortable with her because she is so down to earth. I had moments where I'm like, 'That's my girl,' and I'm like, 'Oh shoot, that's Britney Spears!''</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;Capitalfm.com, Lovato feels that they have lived similar lives in some ways. Lovato was interviewed by&nbsp;The Sun&nbsp;and said,&nbsp;"It's pretty obvious that we've been through some of the same things for sure. We have kept in touch." She also said, "We've definitely bonded, I think because we've been through the same stuff. But if we did have a heart-to-heart I probably wouldn't tell a magazine about it!"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Start Of A Fan War… Did Demi Lovato Use A Fake Account To Slam Selena Gomez?</a></span></p><p>In 2012, Lovato told&nbsp;People.com&nbsp;in November 2012&nbsp;that she&nbsp;enjoyed&nbsp;spending time with Spears and while she thought that she would be conceited and materialistic like some pop stars are, that wasn't the case at all.</p><p>Lovato said, “What surprised me the most about Britney is that she’s actually really quirky. You kind of expect a legendary pop star [to] sometimes [be], like, a diva or something, but she’s really not. She’s a sweet, down-to-earth, Southern girl."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=britney-s-2020-struggles>Britney's 2020 Struggles</h2><p>It sounds like the two had a great connection and really got along. But this year, it has become more clear to Spears' fans that she is under conservatorship and that means that she can't do the things that she used to do. According to&nbsp;Women's Health, this situation began in 2008 and as of 2019, Spears' dad, Jamie, isn't her&nbsp;conservator anymore.&nbsp;Jodi Montgomery has been put in that role.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Fox News, this also means that the singer's conservator is in charge of her money and any other choices that have to be made. She isn't allowed to have a baby or get married. Maxi, a makeup artist, said in a podcast called&nbsp;Calababes, "We’re talking about some 'Handmaid’s Tale'-type things to keep her from having a baby. Like, we’re talking … I can’t detail it and I’m not gonna specifically say, but I will say for sure, she would’ve had a baby by now. She would’ve probably been married to [boyfriend] Sam [Asghari, 26] by now. She would have groups of friends around her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the summer 0f 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lovato wrote "beautiful" on Britney Spears' Instagram</a> and said that she missed her. Fans were happy to see that and thought that Lovato was "supportive."&nbsp;It doesn't seem like the stars have been close more recently than 2012 and 2013, though, as all of the interviews that Lovato gave about Spears were from that time period.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perez Hilton Mocks Max Ehrich Post-Break-Up With Demi Lovato ‘He Needs To Handle It’</a></span></p><h2 id=common-troubles>Common Troubles</h2><p>According to&nbsp;USA Today, Lovato went to&nbsp;the hospital in 2018 and explained that she had been sober for six years but she was going through a relapse.&nbsp;Insider.com&nbsp;notes that the singer has also suffered from an eating disorder.</p><p>While Spears and Lovato have had different struggles, it makes sense that Lovato would be able to relate to the "...Baby One More Time" singer, as they have both gone through tough times in front of the whole world. That definitely can't be easy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Is Britney Spears’ Real Hair Color?</a></span></p><p>While it doesn't sound like Demi Lovato and Britney Spears hang out now, they did connect with one another on&nbsp;The X Factor, and it sounds like it was a great friendship at the time. Sadly, it seems like Spears has been living a pretty isolated life as a result of her conservatorship, and fans&nbsp;would love to know if everything is alright.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Demi Lovato’s Fiancé Once Said About Selena Gomez</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmLmwv8RmmKudXZe%2FqsDNnrBmq6CarrO%2FjJqlnWWUmrqqecuorZqsn2Q%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-close-are-britney-spears-and-demi-lovato.html&text=How%20Close%20Are%20Britney%20Spears%20And%20Demi%20Lovato%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-close-are-britney-spears-and-demi-lovato.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-close-are-britney-spears-and-demi-lovato.html&title=How%20Close%20Are%20Britney%20Spears%20And%20Demi%20Lovato%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-close-are-britney-spears-and-demi-lovato.html&title=How%20Close%20Are%20Britney%20Spears%20And%20Demi%20Lovato%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-close-are-britney-spears-and-demi-lovato.html&title=How%20Close%20Are%20Britney%20Spears%20And%20Demi%20Lovato%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-close-are-britney-spears-and-demi-lovato.html&description=How%20Close%20Are%20Britney%20Spears%20And%20Demi%20Lovato%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-amanda-cerny-in-a-relationship-with-johannes-bartl-dating-life-explored.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Amanda Cerny In A Relationship With Johannes Bartl?
