In reality, however, most people only figure out what they want in a partner after making a lot of mistakes including dating the wrong person. One of the main reasons for that is the fact that so many people grow up believing that the version of love they see in romantic comedies and sitcoms is realistic. For example, anyone who wants to pattern their love life after <a href=#>Ted from How I Met Your Mother’s relationships</a> is going to have a really bad time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, long time How I Met Your Mother fans will remember that Jason Segel’s Marshall Eriksen and Alyson Hannigan’s Lily Aldrin were the hit sitcom’s bedrock couple. However, even though it seems like those two characters were meant to be the show’s most lovable characters, <a href=#>some HIMYM fans think Marshall is the worst</a>. For the rest of How I Met Your Mother’s fans, it is likely to be shocking that so many people dislike Marshall as a character. Similarly, anyone who thought that Jason Segel’s How I Met Your Mother character was one-half of a lovely fictional relationship may be shocked to learn the actor has failed to find lasting love.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How I Met Your Mother: 10 Signs You're The Marshall Of Your Friend Group</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jason-segel-rsquo-s-troubled-love-life>Jason Segel’s Troubled Love Life</h2><p>As a professional actor, Jason Segel has spent a huge portion of his adult years pretending to be someone other than himself. Despite that, most people seem to believe that Segel and a lot of the characters he’s played are very similar. While that may seem silly in a lot of ways, it makes some sense since Segel seems to carry himself with the same energy that makes people love his characters.</p><p>Just like most of the characters he has played on the big and little screen, it has always seemed like there is one word that perfectly describes Jason Segel, lovable. Sadly, however, Segel has yet to find the person he wants to spend the rest of his life with as of the time of this writing. Instead, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Segel has been involved in a series of relationships</a> throughout his adult life, most of which didn’t last long at all.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Serial Daters In Hollywood Who Have Dated Over 5 Different Celebs</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for Jason Segel, it seems like 2021 was a very unfortunate year for his love life from the outside looking in. After all, in mid-2021 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Segel and his girlfriend of 8 years, photographer Alexis Mixter, split up</a>. In an Instagram post, Mixter beautifully wrote about her romantic relationship with Segel coming to an end. "I've never spent so much time with another person, grown so much alongside someone else, laughed so much, cried so much, shared so much. It is odd to write about the end of a relationship, especially when the friendship that still exists is so full of life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During a 2012 interview with iVillage, Jason Segel explained that he thinks that dating a fellow actor “does help”. With that in mind, it makes sense that the rest of Segel’s former girlfriends are professional actors. Most notably, Segel dated his former Freaks and Geeks onscreen love interest Linda Cardellini from 2001 until 2007. Aside from dating Cardellini, the rest of Segel’s relationships with actors were remarkably short-lived.</p><p>Soon after Jason Segel and Linda Cardellini split, he dated Drew Barrymore in 2008 but they went their separate ways before the year ended. Amazingly enough, in 2009, Segel was romantically linked to four actors, Chloë Sevigny, Michelle Ryan, Michelle Trachtenberg, and Lindsay Lohan. After a couple of years of singledom, Segel was involved with Michelle Williams from 2012 until 2013 and then the Serbian actor Bojana Novakovic from 2013 until 2014.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here Are All The Women Jason Segel Has Been Linked To</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jason-segel-made-millions-from-one-romantic-failing>Jason Segel Made Millions From One Romantic Failing</h2><p>Given how successful the show was, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How I Met Your Mother’s stars are all quite wealthy</a>. When it comes to Jason Segel, however, it is clear that he owes a huge portion of his fortune to his film career. For example, Segel earned a lot of money from starring in and writing the script for the rom-com Forgetting Sarah Marshall.</p><p>When Forgetting Sarah Marshall was released, a lot of people were talking about a scene in which Jason Segel’s character was completely in the buff when his girlfriend dumped him. As it turns out, that scene was based on something that really happened to Segel since he was unclothed when a past girlfriend started to end their relationship. While talking to the Los Angeles Times about that incident, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Segel explained his unique reaction to the moment</a>. “It’s like my sickness, but the whole time I’m trying to be present, and all I’m thinking is, ‘This is the funniest thing that has ever happened! Let her leave so I can write this down immediately!’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, when most people go through a breakup, they can’t use that experience as fodder for a movie scene that will advance their career. On top of that, Segel has been involved with some extremely high-caliber people over the years. With all of that in mind, it seems clear that Segel’s love life isn’t cursed, it has been blessed.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' Is Actually Based On This Actor's Breakup</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmqufo3q0scaeo2avmZuybq3Lnq%2Biq12itrnAxKtkrKicnsFuvs6mmKesmZh6qbXSraarsV2ctrO4xaugnqaUZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-jason-segel-s-love-life-cursed.html&text=Is%20Jason%20Segel%27s%20Love%20Life%20Cursed%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-jason-segel-s-love-life-cursed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-jason-segel-s-love-life-cursed.html&title=Is%20Jason%20Segel%27s%20Love%20Life%20Cursed%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-jason-segel-s-love-life-cursed.html&title=Is%20Jason%20Segel%27s%20Love%20Life%20Cursed%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-jason-segel-s-love-life-cursed.html&title=Is%20Jason%20Segel%27s%20Love%20Life%20Cursed%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-jason-segel-s-love-life-cursed.html&description=Is%20Jason%20Segel%27s%20Love%20Life%20Cursed%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kal-penn-wife-who-is-kal-penn-s-fianc%C3%A9-josh.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kal Penn Wife: Who Is Kal Penns Fianc Josh?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./heels-recap-a-tale-of-two-parties.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heels Recap: A Tale of Two Parties">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
