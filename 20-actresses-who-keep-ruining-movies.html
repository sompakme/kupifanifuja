You may have an engaging script. You may have one of the best directors in the business. But you would still need a talented cast to help&nbsp;execute the film's overall vision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is precisely why a lot of film productions are more than willing to shell out millions of dollars just to land some of the best acting talents in the business. There has always been a belief that a film’s success would largely depend on who is playing what. And in some ways, that is true.</p><p>Over the years, we’ve seen this happen. Fans flocking to the cinema to see their favorite actors and actress in their latest movies. Despite this, however, there have been a number of actresses who also went on to ruin rather good movies. As a result, they were met with criticism by film critics and fans alike. Just check out what we found:</p><h2 id=pamela-anderson><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Pamela Anderson</span></h2><p>Pamela Anderson is best known for two things: being a ‘Baywatch’ star and being incredibly hot. Over the years, she has also starred in movies such as “Barb Wire,” “Naked Souls,” “Scary Movie 3” and “Scooby-Doo.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it seemed that people were more drawn to her personal life rather than the roles she played in various films. This was particularly the case during the time a video of Anderson and then-husband Tommy Lee had surfaced.</p><h2 id=maggie-grace><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Maggie Grace</span></h2><p>Maggie Grace is an actress&nbsp;who rose to celebrity status when she starred in “Taken” as Liam Neeson’s daughter. However, many believe that her performance was less than stellar. Criticism was also much worse for her performance in “Taken 2,” particularly during her running scene.</p><p>As author Jeffrey Somers wrote on his website, “In this scene, Maggie Grace is supposedly a 20-something girl in good shape who is running for her life. And Maggie Grace runs like she has an invisible bear riding on her shoulders, or like she’s secretly a 909-year old woman with two hip replacements.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ali-larter><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Ali Larter</span></h2><p>Ali Larter is one actress who has been in the industry for years. She has been in movies such as “Legally Blonde,” “Final Destination,” “House on Haunted Hill,” “American Outlaws,” “Resident Evil: Extinction” and many others.</p><p>Meanwhile, her performance in the movie “Obsessed” earned her a Razzie Awards nomination for Worst Supporting Actress.</p><h2 id=tyra-banks><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Tyra Banks</span></h2><p>Don’t get us wrong. Tyra Banks is one amazing woman. We’re talking about someone who managed to build her own production empire, starting with the long-running reality show “America’s Next Top Model.”</p><p>Over the years, she has also taken on some movie roles, such as “Coyote Ugly” and “Life-Size 2.” Unfortunately, audiences found her acting to be quite stiff.</p><h2 id=shannon-elizabeth><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Shannon Elizabeth</span></h2><p>Shannon Elizabeth is an actress that is best known for her role as exchange student Nadia in the R-rated comedy “American Pie.” Unfortunately, there is some consensus that this was already the best acting performance of Elizabeth’s career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, she even received The Stinkers Bad Movie Awards nominations for Worst Supporting Actress and Most Annoying Fake Accent: Female for her performance in “American Pie 2,” according to records from IMDb.</p><h2 id=marley-shelton><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Marley Shelton</span></h2><p>Just like other actresses on this list, Marley Shelton has also been in the industry for quite some time. In fact, she has starred in movies such as “Nixon,” “Sugar &Spice,” “Bubble Boy,” “Uptown Girls,” “Sin City,” “American Dreamz,” “Grindhouse” and many others.</p><p>However, few remember her name or performance. Moreover, according to Complex, her worst performances were in “Valentine,” “Scream 4,” and “Trojan War.”</p><h2 id=carmen-electra><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Carmen Electra</span></h2><p>Just like Pamela Anderson, Carmen Electra is heavily perceived as a sex symbol in the entertainment industry. This might explain why people find it hard to take her acting seriously. Either that or her acting falls short most of the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, she has earned a Razzie Awards nomination for Worst Supporting Actress for her roles in “Disaster Movie,” “Meet the Spartans,” “Epic Movie,” Dirty Love” and “Starsky & Hutch.” Moreover, she also won that very award for her performances in “Date Movie” and “Scary Movie 4.”</p><h2 id=julianne-hough><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Julianne Hough</span></h2><p>Julianne Hough is an actress who has appeared in movies such as “Footloose,” “Rock of Ages,” “Burlesque,” “Safe Haven,” “Paradise,” “Curve” and many others. However, it was her performance in the 2016 film “Dirty Grandpa” that earned her a Razzie Awards nomination for Worst Supporting Actress.</p><p>To be fair, the movie itself didn’t exactly get great reviews.</p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Lindsay Lohan</span></h2><p>As a child actress, Lindsay Lohan was fun to watch. That’s probably why she ended up doing movies such as “The Parent Trap,” “Freaky Friday,” “Herbie Fully Loaded,” “Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen” and of course, “Mean Girls.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, at some point in her personal life, things went horribly wrong for Lohan. And at the same time, her work onscreen also suffered, leading to poorly received films, such as “The Canyons” and “I Know Who Killed Me.”</p><h2 id=jennifer-love-hewitt><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Jennifer Love Hewitt</span></h2><p>Jennifer Love Hewitt is an actress who is probably best known for her role in the long-running television series “Ghost Whisperer.” On the big screen, Hewitt also appeared in “Garfield,” “Garfield 2,” “The Truth About Love,” “The Suburbans” and “The Tuxedo.”</p><p>According to The Hollywood Reporter, data analysis has revealed that Hewitt is “worst-reviewed actress since 1985.”</p><h2 id=denise-richards><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Denise Richards</span></h2><p>Denise Richards is one actress who happens to be a veteran in the television and movie industries. On the big screen, she’s appeared in films such as “Starship Troopers,” “Wild Things,” “Drop Dead Gorgeous,” “Tail Lights Fade,” “Valentine,” “You Stupid Man,” “Undercover Brother,” “Empire” and many other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it’s her performance in the James Bond movie “The World Is Not Enough” that’s got everyone scratching their heads. On Reddit, one comment read, “Denise Richards is hard to watch. I mean for me as a guy she is easy to watch. However Watching [sic] her act is painful..”</p><h2 id=amanda-bynes><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Amanda Bynes</span></h2><p>Amanda Bynes is someone who ended up going into a downward spiral after enjoying quite a successful career as a young actress. However, Bynes herself stated that she didn’t particularly like her performance on “Easy A.”</p><p>During an interview with Indie Wire, she said, “I literally couldn’t stand my appearance in that movie and I didn’t like my performance. I was absolutely convinced I needed to stop acting after seeing it.”</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Miley Cyrus</span></h2><p>Miley Cyrus is an amazing music artist and performer. However, that doesn’t mean that she is quite the stellar actress too. Of course, many loved her portrayal of Hannah Montana for Disney. However, that’s about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, she received a Razzie Awards nomination for Worst Actress for her performance in “The Last Song.” Moreover, a review from AP stated, “Her dramatic abilities largely consist of two moves — scrunching up her face and staring wistfully into the distance.”</p><h2 id=megan-fox><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Megan Fox</span></h2><p>Don’t get us wrong, Megan Fox can be quite fun to watch on the big screen. However, she isn’t exactly impressive. Over the years, Fox has received a number of Razzie Award Worst Actress nominations for “Jennifer’s Body,” “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,” “Jonah Hex” and “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows.”</p><p>Moreover, she also won a Razzie Award for Worst Actress for her performance in the 2014 movie “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.”</p><h2 id=jennifer-lopez><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jennifer Lopez</span></h2><p>Jennifer Lopez is a multi-skilled performer who is capable of being an engaging actress. Such was the case for her work in movies such as “Selena” and “Anaconda.” However, over the years, Lopez has also received several Razzie Awards nominations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most notable is 2010 nomination for the Worst Actress of the Decade. This is said to be due to her performances in “Angel Eyes,” “Enough,” “Gigli,” “Jersey Girl,” “Maid in Manhattan,” “Monster-in-Law” and “The Wedding Planner.”</p><h2 id=mila-kunis><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Mila Kunis</span></h2><p>Without a doubt, Mila Kunis best performance was in the Oscar-winning movie “Black Swan” alongside Natalie Portman. In fact, she even received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture for her work in the movie.</p><p>However, Kunis was also called out for her less than stellar performance in “Jupiter Ascending.” In fact, this movie earned her a “Worst Actress” nomination from Razzie Awards.</p><h2 id=dakota-johnson><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Dakota Johnson</span></h2><p>Dakota Johnson is an actress who is best known for her role in the 2015 movie “Fifty Shades of Grey.” However, her performances in&nbsp;the first and succeeding ‘Fifty Shades’ films were met with harsh criticism.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, she received a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actress for her work in “Fifty Shades Darker.” Moreover, she also won “Worst Actress” and “Worst Screen Combo” for the original ‘Fifty Shades’ film.</p><h2 id=january-jones><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>January Jones</span></h2><p>Several reports have indicated that actress January Jones is particularly difficult to work it. Nonetheless, her performance on the AMC television show “Mad Men” has received high praises. On the big screen, however, it doesn’t look like fans were pleased with her performance as Emma Frost in “X-Men: First Class.”</p><p>As Complex has pointed out, “Last year's superhero knockout X-Men: First Class, in which Jones' performance as the villainous Emma Frost is more the work of a costumed mannequin than a professionally trained actress.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicolette-sheridan><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Nicolette Sheridan</span></h2><p>As you may remember, actress Nicolette Sheridan is well-known for her role as Edie Britt on the ABC tv series “Desperate Housewives.” On the big screen, she has done a number of lackluster films, including “Jewtopia” and “Let’s Kill Ward’s Wife.”</p><p>However, it was her role in “Code Name: The Cleaner” that eventually earned her a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress.</p><h2 id=katherine-heigl><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Katherine Heigl</span></h2><p>As you may know, Katherine Heigl was practically banished from television after she parted ways with “Grey’s Anatomy” creator Shonda Rhimes. Nonetheless, Heigl continues working and appeared in films such as “The Ugly Truth,” “27 Dresses,” “Life as We Know It” and many others.</p><p>Aside from this, she also starred in “Unforgettable,” “One of the Money,” “The Big Wedding” and “Home Sweet Hell,” all of which got her a Razzie Awards nomination for Worst Actress or Worst Supporting Actress.</p><p>Sources - &nbsp;Jeffrey Somers Official Website,&nbsp;IMDb,&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter,&nbsp;AP &&nbsp;Indie Wire</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYnKyimsC0sdJmrqGnXaCypryMq6yippmjtG65zq%2Bgnqtf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f20-actresses-who-keep-ruining-movies.html&text=20%20Actresses%20Who%20Keep%20Ruining%20Movies&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f20-actresses-who-keep-ruining-movies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f20-actresses-who-keep-ruining-movies.html&title=20%20Actresses%20Who%20Keep%20Ruining%20Movies" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f20-actresses-who-keep-ruining-movies.html&title=20%20Actresses%20Who%20Keep%20Ruining%20Movies" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f20-actresses-who-keep-ruining-movies.html&title=20%20Actresses%20Who%20Keep%20Ruining%20Movies" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f20-actresses-who-keep-ruining-movies.html&description=20%20Actresses%20Who%20Keep%20Ruining%20Movies" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./here-s-how-much-each-lord-of-the-rings-movie-earned-at-the-box-office.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's How Much Each 'Lord Of The Rings' Movie Earned At The Box Office">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./why-these-housewives-left-rhobh.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why These Housewives Left RHOBH">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
