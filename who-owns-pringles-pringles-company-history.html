However, the brand is currently owned by Kellogg, a global food company known for its diverse range of breakfast foods, cereals, and snacks. The acquisition of Pringles by <b>Kellogg’s</b> in 2012 helped them solidify their position in the international snacks market and became the second-largest snack company worldwide.</p><p>Now that we’ve established the ownership of Pringles, let’s dive into the intriguing history behind this beloved brand.</p><h3>Key Takeaways:</h3><ul><li>Pringles was invented by <b>Procter & Gamble</b> in 1968 and is currently owned by Kellogg.</li><li><b>Kellogg’s</b> acquisition of Pringles in 2012 contributed to the company’s growth in the international snacks market.</li><li>Pringles is known for its unique saddle shape and iconic packaging.</li><li><b>Kellogg’s</b> is a global food company that offers a wide range of popular brands.</li><li>Pringles has become a cultural phenomenon with its loyal following and diverse flavors.</li></ul><h2>The History of Pringles</h2><p>Pringles, the beloved potato-based chips, have an interesting origin story that dates back to the 1950s. The invention of Pringles was prompted by consumer complaints about broken, greasy, and stale potato chips. In response to these concerns, <b>Procter & Gamble</b> assigned chemist Fredric J. Baur the task of developing a new kind of potato chip in 1956.</p><p>For two years, Baur conducted experiments and eventually devised a solution: saddle-shaped chips made from fried dough. However, despite his breakthrough, Baur faced a challenge in making the chips palatable. As a result, he was taken off the project.</p><p>Fortunately, Alexander Liepa joined the team in the mid-1960s to continue Baur’s work. Liepa successfully improved the taste of the chips, earning him credit for the patent. Meanwhile, Baur’s contributions extended beyond flavor enhancement. He also designed the iconic tubular can that is synonymous with Pringles. The unique shape of the Pringles chips is mathematically known as a hyperbolic paraboloid.</p><p>The innovative design of the <b>Pringles can</b> proved to be a game-changer in the snacking industry. The cylinder shape allowed for stacking, effectively preventing the chips from breaking and going stale. It also provided a resealable lid, ensuring freshness for prolonged periods.</p><h2>Pringles Ownership Timeline</h2><p>Pringles, the beloved potato chip brand, has had an interesting journey in terms of ownership. Let’s take a closer look at the timeline of Pringles’ ownership and the companies involved.</p><li><p><strong>1968:</strong> Pringles is initially introduced to the market by Procter & Gamble (P&G) in Indiana. The innovative saddle-shaped chips gain popularity among consumers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gradual Expansion:</strong> Pringles steadily expands its reach beyond Indiana, making its way into other states and eventually crossing borders to capture the taste buds of potato chip enthusiasts around the world.</p></li><li><p><strong>2012:</strong> A significant turning point occurs in Pringles’ ownership when Procter & Gamble sells the brand to Kellogg’s in a deal worth $2.7 billion. This acquisition proves to be a game-changer for Kellogg’s, propelling the company’s presence in the international snacks sector.</p></li><li><p><strong>Current Ownership:</strong> As of today, Kellogg’s remains the proud owner of Pringles, continuing to build on the brand’s legacy and satisfying the cravings of snack lovers worldwide.</p></li><p>Pringles’ journey from Procter & Gamble to Kellogg’s highlights the strategic moves made by both companies to strengthen their positions in the competitive snacks industry.
