It is not necessarily a great way to work, but yes for some it is necessary as otherwise they would be dropped from the project. When it comes to a series, there is a great challenge as the actress has worked a long way to gain recognition in the industry while fitting that particular role. When the actress is in the initial months of pregnancy, they never reveal it as they feel they could be dropped from the project. Usually, the actresses never make an official announcement of their pregnancy. The directors and producers have to alter some scenes to hide their baby bump. The creative team places the camera at such an angle that the baby bump is&nbsp;barely visible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, in some cases like a long series, the producers either shorten the role of the actress or rush through filming so that they have a smaller belly to work with. Replacements are sometimes used, a cameo of a new celeb to fill the role but that does not always work with fans. It is no doubt a great challenge for any actress to act normally on the sets and tactically hide their bumps. We have studied certain cases where the actress didn’t reveal her pregnancy but concealed it in a smart way, thereby not letting the public know that she is pregnant.</p><p>It’s interesting to know the stories how their pregnancy was actually hidden from the public. Let’s go through such interesting tales and know about the experience of the actors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alyson-hannigan-hiding-pregnancy-through-her-roles>ALYSON HANNIGAN HIDING PREGNANCY THROUGH HER ROLES</h2><p>Alyson Hannigan is a popular American actress who is best known for her role as Willow Rosenberg&nbsp;on the TV series ‘Buffy the Vampire Slayer.’ When she became pregnant, she didn’t stop working. Instead of getting behind the screens, she accepted her roles, worked with full vigor and her directors changed the scenes so that it&nbsp;suited her health conditions. According to a source from Business Insider, she became pregnant twice while she was doing her part in ‘How I met your mother.’</p><p>The first time her pregnancy was hidden, and the second time the directors decided about taking a humorous stand. The first time, she was shown hidden behind the globes and basketballs. Next time, the directors decided that she should be shown full height. There was a sequence where Alyson was going for a hot dog eating competition. Her baby bump was shown, and that of course took a hilarious angle. Viewers thought that it was a part of the scene. Whenever she was shown full height, she used to be given loose clothing and also bags.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alyson is definitely one heck of an actress.

The third season of the serial actually got a nice wrap up so that she could get a good break from her work. Amy was mostly found dressed in suits and loose fitting dresses. Something was worth noticing that she always sat behind the desks and benches so that her baby bump could be kept out of sight of the public easily. Might be Amy worked with the directors this way so that her pregnancy&nbsp;would not affect her show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She never spoke about her pregnancy but preferred to keep it a secret. Later on, after giving birth she talked openly about being a parent. She joked about being a working mom, and saying that staying at home with her kids was a great job. We don't blame her, there is nothing more annoying than going to work, even if you are an actor. It must be nice to kick back and relax with your kids and get to do whatever you want.

Claire&nbsp;was already a mom to 5-year-old Cyrus Michael Christopher, with her husband, Hugh Dancy. The actress didn’t only keep her pregnancy a secret, but also tried to hide it from her Homeland co-stars.

She told Jimmy Fallon that the days she was filming for the show, she used to feel rotten and was not allowed to say why she felt so.&nbsp;This means that she definitely had some tough days where she couldn't say how she really felt, even though she probably felt terrible.</p><p>The life of a celebrity tends to be full of sacrifices. They are bound by contractual rules that do not allow them to have normal pregnancies. And in case they become pregnant, they try to keep it a secret for fear of being thrown away from the project.&nbsp; (Source: People.com, Businessinsider.com)</p><h2 id=courteney-cox-pregnant-at-the-end-of-friends>COURTENEY COX PREGNANT&nbsp;at the end of friends</h2><p>Courteney Cox is an American actress-director popularly known for her character played in "Friends" and also horror series "Scream." When she got pregnant on the series of Friends, the writers landed up in a problem as the storyline could not be altered. Monica and Chandler as per the story could not conceive, and the characters had already opted for adoption. In this time, Cox became pregnant with her daughter Coco. Just to hide her pregnancy Monica had to wear loose clothes until the end of the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The directors had a number of techniques that they used to show she was not pregnant on the show.

Alongside that and her loose clothes, she was often seen in the back of something or carrying something that would block her stomach. Although Courteney’s baby bump was clearly visible at the end of the series, the directors still tried their best to ensure that it would not be seen.</p><p>Well, we understand that she preferred hiding her belly as she could be barred from featuring in the projects she signed for.

The fans actually criticized the director as he couldn’t entirely hide the pregnancy of Debra. The scenes used to be planned in a way as if the actress started wearing loose-fitting dresses instead of chic tight-fitting outfits. During the last days of her pregnancy, she had to quit the series "Will and Grace."</p><p>Initially, she had to hide her pregnancy, but later the directors covered her pregnancy in the script, and she was expected to play in the same way. Also, there was a rumor reading her pregnancy in the series, but then fans came to know that she was pregnant in reality. Debra became&nbsp;an Emmy winner and said that she wants to spend more and more time with her son.</p><p>It is unfortunate that the show got some backlash due to all of this, but what matters to everyone is just the fact that she managed to keep her cool as long as she could.

She was working on the series ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ which was the beginning of Season Six. The show shot her from her neck, back, or using angles that suited them so as not to show the bump.&nbsp;Then there was the plot point in which her character Meredith actually donated her liver to her father Thatcher. This plot actually gave her some time so that she could cope up with maternity leave.</p><p>Now, when she started, she didn’t have any plans of getting pregnant. But as she approached the mega project of Grey’s Anatomy, her character became very significant. In fact, there were several techniques employed to deal with her pregnancy which the director did not intend to show to the public.

The assistant art director Clyde Koltz was not sure if she was going to continue with the show. Then he decided to include her pregnancy into the scripts of X-files. Gillian said that she faced difficult times as her feet swelled and she became exhausted in between the scenes.
