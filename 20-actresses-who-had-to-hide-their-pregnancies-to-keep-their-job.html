It is not necessarily a great way to work, but yes for some it is necessary as otherwise they would be dropped from the project. When it comes to a series, there is a great challenge as the actress has worked a long way to gain recognition in the industry while fitting that particular role. When the actress is in the initial months of pregnancy, they never reveal it as they feel they could be dropped from the project. Usually, the actresses never make an official announcement of their pregnancy. The directors and producers have to alter some scenes to hide their baby bump. The creative team places the camera at such an angle that the baby bump is&nbsp;barely visible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, in some cases like a long series, the producers either shorten the role of the actress or rush through filming so that they have a smaller belly to work with. Replacements are sometimes used, a cameo of a new celeb to fill the role but that does not always work with fans. It is no doubt a great challenge for any actress to act normally on the sets and tactically hide their bumps. We have studied certain cases where the actress didnâ€™t reveal her pregnancy but concealed it in a smart way, thereby not letting the public know that she is pregnant.</p><p>Itâ€™s interesting to know the stories how their pregnancy was actually hidden from the public. Letâ€™s go through such interesting tales and know about the experience of the actors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alyson-hannigan-hiding-pregnancy-through-her-roles>ALYSON HANNIGAN HIDING PREGNANCY THROUGH HER ROLES</h2><p>Alyson Hannigan is a popular American actress who is best known for her role as Willow Rosenberg&nbsp;on the TV series â€˜Buffy the Vampire Slayer.â€™ When she became pregnant, she didnâ€™t stop working. Instead of getting behind the screens, she accepted her roles, worked with full vigor and her directors changed the scenes so that it&nbsp;suited her health conditions. According to a source from Business Insider, she became pregnant twice while she was doing her part in â€˜How I met your mother.â€™</p><p>The first time her pregnancy was hidden, and the second time the directors decided about taking a humorous stand. The first time, she was shown hidden behind the globes and basketballs. Next time, the directors decided that she should be shown full height. There was a sequence where Alyson was going for a hot dog eating competition. Her baby bump was shown, and that of course took a hilarious angle. Viewers thought that it was a part of the scene. Whenever she was shown full height, she used to be given loose clothing and also bags.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alyson is definitely one heck of an actress.

The third season of the serial actually got a nice wrap up so that she could get a good break from her work. Amy was mostly found dressed in suits and loose fitting dresses. Something was worth noticing that she always sat behind the desks and benches so that her baby bump could be kept out of sight of the public easily. Might be Amy worked with the directors this way so that her pregnancy&nbsp;would not affect her show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She never spoke about her pregnancy but preferred to keep it a secret. Later on, after giving birth she talked openly about being a parent. She joked about being a working mom, and saying that staying at home with her kids was a great job.

When she got pregnant on the series of Friends, the writers landed up in a problem as the storyline could not be altered. Monica and Chandler as per the story could not conceive, and the characters had already opted for adoption. In this time, Cox became pregnant with her daughter Coco.

Although Courteneyâ€™s baby bump was clearly visible at the end of the series, the directors still tried their best to ensure that it would not be seen.</p><p>Well, we understand that she preferred hiding her belly as she could be barred from featuring in the projects she signed for.

During the last days of her pregnancy, she had to quit the series "Will and Grace."</p><p>Initially, she had to hide her pregnancy, but later the directors covered her pregnancy in the script, and she was expected to play in the same way.

This plot actually gave her some time so that she could cope up with maternity leave.</p><p>Now, when she started, she didnâ€™t have any plans of getting pregnant. But as she approached the mega project of Greyâ€™s Anatomy, her character became very significant. In fact, there were several techniques employed to deal with her pregnancy which the director did not intend to show to the public.
