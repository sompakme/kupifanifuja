The show's gripping narrative, compelling characters, and visceral depiction of a post-apocalyptic world gripped viewers from the very first episode. The series amassed a dedicated fan base and consistently high ratings, making it one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most-watched shows on television</a>.</p><p>The show got many things right, including the casting of Norman Reedus.</p><p>Norman Reedus' performance as Daryl Dixon showcased his versatility as an actor. From the character's introduction in the first season, to his evolution as a resilient survivor, Reedus imbued Daryl with a mix of toughness, vulnerability, and unexpected tenderness.</p><p>Reedus' portrayal of Daryl Dixon propelled him to new heights of fame and cemented his status as a pop culture icon. The character's popularity led to a surge in merchandise, including action figures, apparel, and even a cookbook inspired by the show.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Reedus made $8,500 per episode in season 2. Eight seasons later, and his salary has since skyrocketed to $1 million per episode, which makes him one of the highest paid actors on TV, according to Variety," the site reported.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The site didn't stop there, adding additional context, including the departure of the show's former lead star, and some other incentives that Reedus had worked into his contract.</p><p>"Us Weekly reported in 2018 that Reedus signed a new deal with AMC to receive $20 million after The Walking Deadâ€˜s previous lead, Andrew Lincoln, left the show. Given that the series often averages around 20 episodes per season, the $20 million likely accounts for the $1 million Reedus receives per episode. THR also reported tin 2018 that Reedus was one of two actors who signed a three-year, which would pay him anywhere from $50 million to $90 million even if his character is written off," the site continued.</p><p>There aren't many stars that are capable of cracking that type of salary, but few people are able to land popular roles on iconic shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reedus was making a fortune, but he wasn't the only Walking Dead star to secure the bag.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does The Cast of The Last of Us Hate The Walking Dead?

Before he left, the actor made an impressive $650,000 per episode, according to Cheat Sheet, which wouldâ€™ve accounted for $13 million per season," the site reported.</p><p>Melissa McBride earned a fortune, as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Like Reedus, McBrideâ€™s salary has also increased exponentially.
