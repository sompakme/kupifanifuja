They deserve first-class luxury in the form of soothing hand lotions.</p><h3><strong>How to shop for hand creams</strong></h3><p>Grab your favorite shoes and wallet because it’s time to go shopping for the best hand creams in 2024. Not all hand creams are created equal. Here are the features you should be aware of while you shop.</p><h4><strong>Know your skin type and concerns</strong></h4><p>Finding the right hand cream is all about balance. The right cream should contain the right ingredients for your skin without irritating. Identify your skin’s needs before narrowing down your shopping list.</p><p>Do you have sensitive skin that gets fussed about the slightest harsh ingredient? If so, you’ll likely need products with gentle, botanical-based ingredients that are free from harsh chemicals. Those with skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, or rosacea should be especially careful when selecting products and always look for skin-safe ingredients that support the skin’s natural microbiome.</p><p>Identify any other skin concerns you may have, like rough, bumpy texture or wrinkles. Hand creams contain a myriad of ingredients, and there will be a unique hand cream perfect for your issues.</p><h4><strong>Good ingredients for your hands&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Keep those scoopers fresh by using safe-for-skin ingredients that recharge and rehydrate. There are so many moisturizing ingredients that you’ll find in top-tier hand cream products. The trick is to find the best ingredients for your skin type.</p><p><b>Here are the top ingredients to look for in hand cream:&nbsp;</b></p><ul><li aria-level=1><strong>Shea butter</strong> is one of the top recommended ingredients for your hands. It’s not overly oily or nourishing like coconut oil—or other intense hydrating oils—but still provides a thick layer of moisture and comfort for the skin.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Ceramides</strong> boost and strengthen the skin barrier, which is essential for your small appendages. Because your hands are the most used resource on your body, you must protect that skin at all costs. Ceramides ensure your skin stays hydrated, healthy, and free from irritation. They won’t protect you from a patch of poison ivy, but they may reduce stress from common irritants and environmental stressors.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Hyaluronic acid</strong> is the IT Girl of the 21st-century self-care industry. Find it in face moisturizers, hand creams, and body lotions. There’s a reason so many brands are adding hyaluronic acid to their self-care products. It’s because it’s an incredibly moisturizing ingredient that attracts extreme moisture and helps skin appear more plump and full, which makes it the perfect candidate for hand cream. If your hands look dry or dull, hyaluronic acid can restore volume while hydrating from within.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Coconut oil</strong> is an intensely moisturizing ingredient that can moisturize dehydrated hands. When your hands are in serious need of hydration, reach for a hand cream with coconut oil. While it may be too hydrating for some folks, it’s the best balm for dry, rough skin.</li></ul><h4><strong>Ingredients to avoid&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Do your best to avoid harsh ingredients and chemicals. This applies to products for your skin and hair as well. Harmful ingredients cause unwanted reactions and irritations and often result in inflammation, irritation, and itchy, flaky, or dry skin.</p><p>Common ingredients to avoid include parabens, artificial fragrances, sulfates, phthalates, synthetic dyes, mineral oil, PEGs, and formaldehyde.</p><h3><strong>Tips and tricks to take better care of your hands</strong></h3><p>Your hands take the brunt of all your daily activities. Whether you have a physically demanding job or sit behind a desk chicken-pecking the keyboard, it doesn’t matter. Your little digits could use some extra TLC. Our top tips and tricks will help you take better care of your hands.</p><h4><strong>How to apply hand cream</strong></h4><p>We know you’re no rookie when it comes to hand cream. But a few tips can help you get the most with each application.</p><p>Always apply hand cream to fresh, clean skin. Avoid applying hand cream if your hands are covered in irritants or pollutants, like right after gardening or touching irritating objects.</p><p>When you do apply hand cream, read the directions to ensure you’re getting the right amount of lotion each time. Then gently massage the cream into your hands and fingers and allow it to dry before using your hands for other things.</p><h4><strong>How often to apply hand cream</strong></h4><p>How frequently you apply hand cream depends on various factors, including how often you wash your hands, how dry your hands feel, and whether you have a strong skin barrier.</p><p>If your job requires regular hand washing, you can follow it up with a quick layer of lightweight hand cream to keep your hands feeling soft and hydrated. Anytime you notice your hands are rough, dry, or cracked, you should use hand cream to restore moisture.</p><h4><strong>Don’t forget the SPF</strong></h4><p>If you want to have the graceful hands of a person 20+ years younger, don’t forget to apply SPF to the backs of your hands. We know that this sounds like overkill because surely your hands won’t get t<i>hat many</i> wrinkles. But that’s simply untrue.</p><p>Your hands will get wrinkly, loose, and saggy, just like the rest of your body, and sometimes even more, because people forget to cover them and protect them from the sun. By protecting them from the sun, you can prevent premature skin aging and old lady (or man) hands when you’re at the ripe age of 40.</p><h4><strong>Please patch test</strong></h4><p>If you’re looking for a hand cream, chances are you regularly deal with scaly, rough, or dry skin or have a skin condition like eczema or psoriasis. Everyone-–no matter your skin type—should perform a patch test before using a new product.</p><p>Patch tests are quick, easy, and typically painless (but some reactions from new products may irritate your skin). Let’s walk through a patch test. Clean a visible patch of skin, like the inside of your wrist, and pat it dry. Then apply your new product—like a hand cream—to the clean area and check it frequently over the next 24 hours.</p><p>If you don’t see signs of irritation like red, rough, bumpy, or itchy spots, it’s more than likely safe to use on other areas of your body.</p><h2><strong>Frequently asked questions&nbsp;</strong></h2><h3><strong>What causes dry hands?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Several factors, including skin type can cause dry hands, how frequently you wash your hands, and the weather. For many people, the weather plays a huge factor in skin dryness. In the winter, our hands are subjected to extreme cold and then heat indoors with lower humidity levels, which dries out the hands. For some, dry hands are just a way of life, especially for those with skin conditions like eczema.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3><strong>What’s the best hand cream in 2024?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Blu Atlas Body Lotion</a></strong> is the best hand cream in 2024.
