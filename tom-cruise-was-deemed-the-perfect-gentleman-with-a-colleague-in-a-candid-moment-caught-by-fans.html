He gifted a former co-star a pen, while he's also known for helping others and is always willing to be available as well.</p><p>Mission: Impossible co-star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Simon Pegg also discussed the actor's generosity.</a></p><p>"Of all the mist of stuff that's around him, in the center of that mist is a generous, sweet guy who looks after everybody. He leads from the top down. And he's kind of inspiring to be around. There's no one else like him, he's the last movie star of the old kind."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The One Actress That Turned Down A Role To Star Alongside Both Nicole Kidman And Tom Cruise</a></span></p><p>Pegg continues, "When I first met him, it was my first time to Hollywood," he told the outlet. "He came to set the first day we met, he immediately made me feel very welcome, very at home, was incredibly generous. Over the 17 years that we've been friends, I feel lucky to get to see a part of him that everyone else wants to see, which is just the guy," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"And he is just a guy. He's an extraordinary guy. He's a guy who feels the obligation to the audience to risk his life for them to kind of entertain them."</p><p>That sentiment seems to hold true for others in the business as well. Cruise continues to keep a high standard into his 60s, truly remarkable.</p><h2 id=tom-cruise-made-sure-a-colleague-entered-the-vehicle-before-he-did>Tom Cruise Made Sure A Colleague Entered The Vehicle Before He Did</h2><p>Fans are always interested in watching footage of Tom Cruise in candid situations, finding out what the actor is truly like. For years, Tom has consistently been a class act in public, with his signature smile.</p><p>One moment in particular went viral, showing Cruise acting like a pure gentleman alongside a colleague. The two are about to enter an SUV, but before Cruise gets into his ride, he makes sure that his team member enters first, despite all the chaos surrounding him at the time.

That held true during the shoot of Minority Report. The actor literally stepped aside mid-scene in order to fix an issue his children were having.</p><p>"There were times that I was about ready to say “Action,” and the phone rang. If it was Tom’s kids, everything stopped for that. Just when he was preparing for probably the hardest scene he has in the whole movie, the phone rang. Anybody else would have looked up with anger in their eyes, but he immediately broke character and walked off and took the call."</p><p>"Connor or Isabella had stuck an eraser in their eye or something like that. It was not serious, but Dad came to the rescue. I thought it was amazing. I have been known to say [when talking about his own kids], “I’ll call them back after the shot.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Tom Cruise, his dream was always to be a father and as this story indicates, he takes his role very seriously. Cruise still holds a close relationship with both kids, while his closeness to Suri seems to be strained.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdmL%2B2tdKeZLCZo2LBqbGMqZyrnpWYwW6zxKerpZ2dlrtuw8itn2aZXZi8rbjEmp6unV2eu26tjJyYp5yZmXquu8yepa1lk5bCqLTTZpmyZZaWu7R7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftom-cruise-was-deemed-the-perfect-gentleman-with-a-colleague-in-a-candid-moment-caught-by-fans.html&text=Tom%20Cruise%20Was%20Deemed%20The%20Perfect%20Gentleman%20With%20A%20Colleague%20In%20A%20Candid%20Moment%20Caught%20By%20Fans&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftom-cruise-was-deemed-the-perfect-gentleman-with-a-colleague-in-a-candid-moment-caught-by-fans.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftom-cruise-was-deemed-the-perfect-gentleman-with-a-colleague-in-a-candid-moment-caught-by-fans.html&title=Tom%20Cruise%20Was%20Deemed%20The%20Perfect%20Gentleman%20With%20A%20Colleague%20In%20A%20Candid%20Moment%20Caught%20By%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftom-cruise-was-deemed-the-perfect-gentleman-with-a-colleague-in-a-candid-moment-caught-by-fans.html&title=Tom%20Cruise%20Was%20Deemed%20The%20Perfect%20Gentleman%20With%20A%20Colleague%20In%20A%20Candid%20Moment%20Caught%20By%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftom-cruise-was-deemed-the-perfect-gentleman-with-a-colleague-in-a-candid-moment-caught-by-fans.html&title=Tom%20Cruise%20Was%20Deemed%20The%20Perfect%20Gentleman%20With%20A%20Colleague%20In%20A%20Candid%20Moment%20Caught%20By%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftom-cruise-was-deemed-the-perfect-gentleman-with-a-colleague-in-a-candid-moment-caught-by-fans.html&description=Tom%20Cruise%20Was%20Deemed%20The%20Perfect%20Gentleman%20With%20A%20Colleague%20In%20A%20Candid%20Moment%20Caught%20By%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./torrey-devitto-dating-cubs-manager-david-ross-after-will-estes-split.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Torrey DeVitto Dating Cubs Manager David Ross After Will Estes Split">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-best-foundations-for-rosacea.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Best Foundations for Rosacea">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
