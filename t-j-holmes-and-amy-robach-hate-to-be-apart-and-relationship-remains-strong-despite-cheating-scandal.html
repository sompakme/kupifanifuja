I can't pinpoint," Holmes said on the Amy and T.J. podcast in February 2024, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confessing to falling in love in Spring 2022</a>. He would only file for divorce in December 2022 (although, in the podcast, Holmes did claim that he did not discuss his feelings with Robach at the time).</p><h2 id=what-have-amy-robach-and-t-j-holmes-said-about-their-cheating-scandal>What Have Amy Robach And T.J.
