And you’re in luck, because we have twenty of them right here for you! This is our list of the hottest Victoria Secret models of all time, looking where they look best: On the runway!&nbsp;Naturally, walking around in the tiny swimsuits, panties, and bras of the famous lingerie retailer requires that a woman have a great figure. But these women take it to a whole new level! We continue to be blown away by these lovely ladies, and they are not only attractive, but they are intelligent and hardworking as well, After all, it isn’t easy being a top-notch model!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of which, many of these women have solidified their names as iconic figures in the modeling industry. We have women here who were part of the first group of Victoria’s Secret Angels (like Karen Mulder, Helena Christensen, and <a href=#>Tyra Banks</a>). There are also models who are part of the “New Supers,” such as Karlie Kloss. And then there are the models that we never want to say goodbye to...hello, <a href=#>Gisele Bundchen</a> and <a href=#>Adriana Lima</a>! Be prepared for this list, because we have a lot of hotness coming your way!</p><p>We hope that you enjoy learning a bit more about these models. After reading through our list, you may even want to do some more research on your own! Many of these ladies are pursuing other endeavors as well, such as coding, writing, and working with other businesses. You can even find some of them vlogging on YouTube!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=20-ana-beatriz-barros><strong>20. Ana Beatriz Barros</strong></h2><p>33-year-old Brazilian model Ana Beatriz Barros is one of the gorgeous women to have strutted down the Victoria’s Secret catwalk. She was discovered when she was just 13 years old, and was spotted in Rio de Janeiro. Since then, she has graced the cover of Sports Illustrated, as well as modeled for such iconic fashion brands as Guess? And Chanel. Lingerie just seems to be her best niche when it comes to being a model. After all, she was a favorite in the Victoria’s Secret catalog, and she was an ambassador for the Italian lingerie line Intimissimi for years. Now she is the brand’s main spokesmodel.</p><p></p><h2 id=19-brooklyn-decker><strong>19. Brooklyn Decker</strong></h2><p>Would you believe that the downright beautiful <a href=#>Brooklyn Decker</a> is a mother? She may be only 28 years of age, but she is a nurturer to her baby boy Hank, and to the swathes of people who drool over photos of her in stunning fashion. Brooklyn is perhaps best known for her ultra-sexy covers on Sports Illustrated’s Swimsuit Edition, but she has also donned some lovely lingerie for Victoria’s Secret. She has been spotted in other areas of the media as well, including film (Battleship, What to Expect When You’re Expecting) and the eating disorder community (she struggled with body image and anorexia). Decker is the only model on this list, who did not have a photo of her on the runway. But when you get to look at her in a bikini, are you really going to complain?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=18-helena-christensen><strong>18. Helena Christensen</strong></h2><p>Danish gal <a href=#>Helena Christensen </a>was one of the old-school models who worked with Victoria’s Secret. Her beauty still stands the test of time, even though she is 47 years old now. Helena was actually one of the first Victoria’s Secret Angels, back when the group included <a href=#>Tyra Banks</a> and <a href=#>Heidi Klum</a>. Therefore, Helena is a role model even for models! She also appeared on countless magazine covers, as well as music videos and television campaigns. Now she is a successful model-businesswoman who works as a photographer (previously she was a creative director for Nylon magazine). Her European elegance and charm is still hot.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=17-stephanie-seymour><strong>17. Stephanie Seymour</strong></h2><p>Another iconic and early Victoria’s Secret model was <a href=#>Stephanie Seymour</a>. She is still looking delightful into her mid-40s! She got her start in the modeling industry when she was just 16 years old, and she even made it to the finals of Elite Model Management’s first Model of the Year competition. So, naturally, modeling was in a natural career path for her. She then&nbsp;went on to model for Gap, Playboy, and FHM. Now she is not only a modeling icon, but she is an actress and author (go check out her book Stephanie Seymour’s Beauty Secrets for Dummies!)</p><p></p><h2 id=16-karen-mulder><strong>16. Karen Mulder</strong></h2><p>When Victoria’s Secret models are training they probably learn all about Karen Mulder. After all, she was one of the models who was there when Victoria’s Secret was just becoming hot on the modeling scene. She had the classic supermodel physique: feminine contours, the perfect blonde blowout, and fully pouty lips. It really is no wonder that she was strutting alongside other top-notch models such as <a href=#>Claudia Schiffer</a> and <a href=#>Kate Moss</a>. After a tough time during which she battled depression and attempted suicide, she came back with a healthy mindset and her natural and original beauty. She’s a total success story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=15-karlie-kloss><strong>15. Karlie Kloss</strong></h2><p>Thanks to <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>’s girl posse, more and more people are learning about the fabulous <a href=#>Karlie Kloss</a>. Even so, she doesn’t need T-Swift to catapult her star power. Karlie is a 23-year-old model who was internationally recognized by Vogue Paris and was a Victoria’s Secret Angel for 2 years. The Chicago native was even the spokesmodel for various brands, such as Nike, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Donna Karan. Currently, she is rocking it as a huge celeb endorser of L’Oreal cosmetics. You can check out Karlie, up close and personal, on her YouTube vlog, Klossy. We’re bound to see more Karlie in the future.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-lily-aldridge><strong>14. Lily Aldridge</strong></h2><p>30-year-old <a href=#>Lily Aldridge</a> is one of the freshest-faced models we have seen in a while. She is also a Victoria’s Secret model who makes us drool every time we open the catalog. Recently, Lily showed off the latest Victoria’s Secret swimsuits and caused a lot of excitement. Lily also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated’s Swimsuit Edition and has been involved in multiple fashion endorsements, such as Velvet Tees, Rag & Bone, and Proactiv (wait, so she isn’t perfect after all?!), clearly we aren’t the only ones who have noticed Lily’s hotness. <a href=#>Dr. Dre</a>, <a href=#>Eminem</a>, and <a href=#>Snoop Dogg</a> all recruited her to appear in their music vids.</p><p></p><h2 id=13-erin-heatherton><strong>13. Erin Heatherton</strong></h2><p>27-year-old <a href=#>Erin Heatherton</a> has made a name for herself as one of the Victoria’s Secret models of today. She has an ideal body to show off the fashion retailer’s swimsuits and lingerie. Discovered on the beach in Miami and at the age of 17, Erin was taken on by the Marilyn Agency and hit the runway for numerous brands, including Prada, Tommy Hilfiger, and Marc Jacobs. For 6 years straight, she was one of the regular models to strut on the catwalk for the Victoria’s Secret runway shows. Just take a look at her and it is easy to see why! The leggy, blonde-haired, green-eyed model is a delight!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=12-izabel-goulart><strong>12. Izabel Goulart</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Izabel Goulart has a look as exotic and alluring as her name. She is from Brazil and has been modeling with Victoria’s Secret for a decade. She is also one of the hottest faces for Armani Exchange. Perhaps it is her Italian and Portuguese heritage that makes her so attractive, or that she is just naturally tall and thin. She even modeled in France and has been killing it since she was 14 years old. Some of her magazine covers include Vogue, Marie Claire, and GQ Mexico. Models.com repeatedly puts her on the list of The Top 20 Models.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-doutzen-kroes><strong>11. Doutzen Kroes</strong></h2><p>Who cares if we can’t say her name properly? <a href=#>Doutzen&nbsp;Kroes</a>, from the Netherlands, and is one of the hottest Victoria’s Secret models we have seen in a long time. She has been modeling since 2003 and become a Victoria’s Secret Angel in 2008. Her nickname as the “Helen of Troy” of the modeling industry is pretty self-explanatory. Moreover, she is often identified as one of the “New Supers” (new supermodels of today’s era). She recently turned heads while sitting in the audience for Stella McCartney’s Paris Fashion Week. See? This woman doesn’t even have to model to attract people’s eyes!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=10-rosie-huntington-whiteley><strong>10. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley</strong></h2><p>A delicate name for a delicate-looking flower of a woman. But don’t get us wrong; <a href=#>Rosie</a> can definitely get her sexy on! Just take a look at her when she models for Victoria’s Secret. She was also widely recognized as the hot young thing in the 2011 film Transformers: Dark of the Moon. She has appeared on multiple magazine covers, graced the glossy pages of international publications, and was also a spokesmodel for Godiva chocolate (that’s sexy!). She began modeling when she was just 15 years old, and she was so admired by photographers that one (Rankin) created a book dedicated to just her.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-miranda-kerr><strong>9. Miranda Kerr</strong></h2><p>32-year-old Aussie model <a href=#>Miranda Kerr</a> is one of the most naturally gifted and well-endowed Victoria’s Secret models ever. She was also the first Australian model to work for the iconic lingerie retailer. And was even married to&nbsp;<a href=#>Orlando Bloom</a> for a time! Her modeling career began at just 13 years of age, and her work has included ads for KORA Organics, Betsey Johnson, and Levi’s. She has also posed for Harper’s Bazaar, Elle, and Australian Vogue. She was even a guest star on the hit TV series Project Runway. Miranda has solidified herself (and her gorgeous body) as one of the most successful lingerie models of the modern age.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-candice-swanepoel><strong>8. Candice Swanepoel</strong></h2><p>When people mention Victoria’s Secret models, they just about always talk about <a href=#>Candice Swanepoel</a>. She is one of the most luscious women walking for the lingerie brand. She even hangs out with other top-notch models, such as Bella Hadid (sister of Gigi Hadid). The South African model is blonde-haired, blue-eyed excellence, and besides strutting around in sexy panties, she has also modeled for Givenchy, Christian Dior, Donna Karan, Michael Kors...the list goes on and on! FHM consistently names Candice Swanepoel as one of the hottest models, and Maxim even gave her the Number One spot on their 2014 list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-tyra-banks><strong>7. Tyra Banks</strong></h2><p>Where would the world of modeling be without Tyra Banks? She was one of the original Victoria’s Secret Angels, plus she modeled for loads of other fashion retailers. She even helped to create her own modeling competition-reality show, America’s Next Top Model (which is coming back from its hiatus, but without Tyra). She helped pave the way for other black models and she has always been proud of who she is. Now she is one of the most outspoken figures in the modeling industry calling for body positivity and self-love. We would absolutely be thrilled to have more models like Tyra.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-marisa-miller><strong>6. Marisa Miller</strong></h2><p>Take one look at<a href=#> Marisa Miller</a> and you’ll go “va, va, voom!” This busty American model is no doubt one of the hottest faces for Victoria’s Secret and Sports Illustrated’s Swimsuit Edition. The California native is such a modeling force to be reckoned with, that she is considered the catalyst for the new version of the supermodel. Her magazine appearances include Glamour, Maxim, Vanity Fair, Marie Claire, and more. She has also transitioned into acting work (television and film) as well as humanitarian efforts. And not surprisingly, she regularly beats out other high-profile hotties on Maxim’s iconic Hot 100 list.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-behati-prinsloo><strong>5. Behati Prinsloo</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Behati Prinsloo</a> is a 26-year-old Victoria’s Secret model from Namibia. Oh, and she is also the super-hot wife of Maroon 5 band member <a href=#>Adam Levine</a>. What a life! Behati has walked, posed, and modeled for loads of fashion retailers and advertisements. And apparently the perfect-ten body of Behati absolutely adores pizza. She divulged that she and her Victoria’s Secret buddy Lily Aldridge throw a pizza party after the famous VS runway show! She is actually a real-life woman, wow! Even so, she is unlike the girl next door because she has appeared on just about every international edition of Vogue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-alessandra-ambrosio><strong>4. Alessandra Ambrosio</strong></h2><p>Brazilian hottie <a href=#>Alessandra Ambrosio </a>is one of the most well-known Victoria’s Secret models, and it really is not hard to see why. She recently showed up at Paris Fashion Week and had all eyes glued to her envy-inducing curves and luscious locks. Even Victoria’s Secret knows that Alessandra is super sexy, so they chose her as the first model to endorse their PINK line of clothing and lingerie. Besides that, People magazine recognized her as one of the most beautiful people, and Alessandra models regularly for Ralph Lauren and Christian Dior. She’s also an ambassador for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-adriana-lima><strong>3. Adriana Lima</strong></h2><p>One of the most oft-mentioned Victoria’s Secret models is <a href=#>Adriana Lima</a>. The Brazilian model-actress is the lingerie retailer’s longest-working veteran model (she has been with the brand for 15 years). When she was just 16 years old, she was named “Supermodel of the World” by Ford Models, and she is one of the highest-earning models in the world (her net worth is about $65 million). Adriana definitely exhibits a rare mystique and beauty. She is of Brazilian, Portuguese, Japanese, and Swiss heritage, and her olive-colored skin, wavy hair, and light-colored eyes are to die for. Those aren’t her only assets, though!</p><p></p><h2 id=2-heidi-klum><strong>2. Heidi Klum</strong></h2><p>One of the very first Victoria’s Secret supermodels, <a href=#>Heidi Klum</a> has made a name for herself as a model turned successful business woman. Where have we not seen her? Besides working the catwalk in Angel wings and tiny lingerie pieces, she was the host of the hit TV show Project Runway, and she serves as a judge on America’s Got Talent. She was also married to singer <a href=#>Seal</a>&nbsp;for years and has a brood of lovely kids. Every Halloween Heidi surprises us with a sexy costume, and it is something we always look forward to. So, is it October yet?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-gisele-bundchen><strong>1. Gisele Bundchen</strong></h2><p>Brazilian babe <a href=#>Gisele Bundchen</a> has just got to be Number One on our list. She is one of the most iconic Victoria’s Secret models, plus she is married to none other than <a href=#>Tom Brady</a>.
