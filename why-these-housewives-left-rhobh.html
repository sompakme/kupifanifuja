Sometimes it seems like there is a revolving door of Housewives. There are plenty of women who left on semi-good terms and others who left in a wave of drama. This cast is a tough group and those who join better be ready to handle it.</p><p>As Kyle says, "In Beverly Hills, the truth always has a way of rising to the top." The current cast learns that every day. And maybe some past cast members did not.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kyle Richards On Her Own Journey As A "Real Housewives" OG</a></span></p><h2 id=why-yolanda-hadid-left-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Why Yolanda Hadid Left Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yolanda Hadid arrived on RHOBH in season 3 and lasted through season 6. Yolanda's big storyline concerned her Lyme Disease, and some of the women not believing she was really sick. This caused huge problems between her and Lisa Rinna.</p><p>Yolanda finally left the show because Bravo wanted to demote her to "friend" status and not a main housewife. She declined that offer and left the show. She decided to concentrate on her recovery and her family, which included husband, David Foster, and daughters Gigi Hadid and Bella Hadid.</p><p>Yolanda and David have since divorced. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She now lives in New York City and has become a grandmother</a>. She is focusing on her family.</p><h2 id=eileen-davidson-left-rhobh-after-three-seasons><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Eileen Davidson Left RHOBH After Three Seasons</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/eileen-davidson-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eileen Davidson was another Housewife that Bravo wanted in a "limited capacity", aka "friend." The soap star joined the show in season 5 and stayed for three seasons. But she ultimately decided that she wasn't interested in the demotion.</p><p>Davidson was a low-key member of the cast but did have some drama with Kim Richards in season 5.</p><p>She continues to star as Ashley Abbott on The Young and the Restless, and has recently reunited with her former Days of Our Lives and RHOBH co-star Lisa Rinna for Peacock's Days of Our Lives: Beyond Salem.</p><h2 id=teddi-mellencamp-was-fired-from-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Teddi Mellencamp Was Fired From Real Housewives Of Beverly HIlls</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Teddy Mellencamp, daughter of rock star John Mellencamp, was on RHOBH during seasons eight, nine, and ten. She was involved in some big scandals during her time there, including one with Lisa Vanderpump and one with Denise Richards. While some Housewives were demoted, Teddi was actually fired. And she has no problem talking about it.</p><p>Teddi has claimed that her firing was due to her lack of glam. It has also been said that it was because of negative reactions from fans.</p><p><a href=#>The RHOBH alum is now keeping busy as a wife and mom</a>. She is also an accountability coach. And unlike many former cast members, she remains friends with many of her cast mates and has even appeared as a guest on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.</p><h2 id=why-brandi-glanville-left-rhobh><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Why Brandi Glanville Left RHOBH</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brandi Glanville is one of the most controversial ladies ever to star on RHOBH. She appeared on the hit show as a "friend" in season 2 and became full-time from seasons 3 through 5.</p><p>She was constantly fighting with many of the other Housewives, and she was reportedly fired from the show for that reason. She had blowups with Kyle Richards, Lisa Vanderpump and Lisa Rinna. Bravo no longer wanted her diva behavior on the show.</p><p>But Brandi returned to the show in season 10, bringing more drama with her. She claimed to have a sexual relationship with Denise Richards, which Richards denied. She did not return for season 11, but <a href=#>she did appear on Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip season 2</a>, along with former cast mate Taylor Armstrong. There was drama between the two during the trip.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Exclusive: Brandi Glanville Addresses Her RHUGT Beef With Taylor Armstrong</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-armstrong-appeared-in-the-first-three-season-of-rhobh><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Taylor Armstrong Appeared In The First Three Season Of RHOBH</span></h2><p>Taylor was an original RHOBH, appearing in the first three seasons. Fans remember the over the top birthday party she threw for her daughter, Kennedy.</p><p>Rumors were going around that she was in an abusive relationship with her husband, Russell Armstrong. She admitted this was true at the season 2 reunion. She filed for divorce soon after, then Russell died by apparent suicide. She left the show after that because it was too much for her to handle at the time.</p><p>Taylor is a devoted mom to her daughter and has remarried to attorney John Bluher. She appeared on RHUGT season 2 with Brandi Glanville. She has recently made Housewives history by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being the first to move to another RH franchise</a>. She is now a star on RHOC.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-richards-was-fired-from-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kim Richards Was Fired From Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills</span></h2><p>Kim Richards is a former child star and sister of Kyle Richards and Kathy Hilton. She was also an OG on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. She appeared on the first 5 seasons of the show, but left in 2015. She has continued to make appearances throughout the years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Lisa Rinna Stays In Shape At 58 Years Old</a></span></p><p>Kim famously fought with Kyle throughout her run on the show. She also had an epic battle with Lisa Rinna which started over sobriety and culminated in wine and glass throwing. Two years later, the fight continued in "Bunnygate", when <a href=#>Richards returned a stuffed bunny that Rinna had given as a gift for her new grandson</a>. The two have since made up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim was ultimately fired from the show.

Her first season went smoothly, but all hell broke loose during the second. When she was accused of cheating on her husband with Brandi, she began feuding with many of the women, most notably her former friend, Lisa Rinna.</p><p>Richards was not fired or demoted. She left the show. In the end, she and Bravo could not come to an agreement regarding her salary, so she quit. She is a wife and mom and actress. She is still close with Garcelle Beauvais and Sutton Stracke.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-lisa-vanderpump-leave-real-housewives-because-of-puppygate><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Did Lisa Vanderpump Leave Real Housewives Because Of Puppygate?</span></h2><p>Lisa Vanderpump was the exit heard round the world.</p><p>Lisa, also an original housewife, was on the show for 9 seasons. Her final season was brutal, and she ultimately cut ties with all the cast members, including her best friend Kyle. This was all because of a puppy.</p><p>"Puppygate" occurred after Dorit Kemsley adopted "Lucy Lucy Apple Juice" from Vanderpump Dogs. When she did not like the dog's behavior, she gave it away, but the dog ended up in a shelter. The shelter reached out to Vanderpump Dogs, and they got Lucy back. There were then secrets and lies and other cast mates got involved.</p><p>After feeling ganged up on, and then a fight with Kyle, Lisa threw her former bff out of her house and went on to leave the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lisa still stars in her spinoff, Vanderpump Rules.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqbWmv8Rmn6ito5rEqsLErGSlnZaperO0zpufZpqilsOwew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-these-housewives-left-rhobh.html&text=Why%20These%20Housewives%20Left%20RHOBH&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-these-housewives-left-rhobh.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-these-housewives-left-rhobh.html&title=Why%20These%20Housewives%20Left%20RHOBH" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-these-housewives-left-rhobh.html&title=Why%20These%20Housewives%20Left%20RHOBH" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-these-housewives-left-rhobh.html&title=Why%20These%20Housewives%20Left%20RHOBH" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-these-housewives-left-rhobh.html&description=Why%20These%20Housewives%20Left%20RHOBH" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./20-actresses-who-keep-ruining-movies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20 Actresses Who Keep Ruining Movies">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tony-awards-2022-red-carpet-fashion-dresses.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tony Awards 2022: Red Carpet Fashion, Dresses">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
