Numerous accusations of racist behavior between castmates <a href=#>drew significant divides among both the women and the fan base</a>. By the end of season 5, <a href=#>Dr. Tiffany Moon was refusing to shoot scenes with Kameron Westcott</a>. Rather than recast, production decided to stop shooting the series altogether. While some fans are hopeful to see the Real Housewives of Dallas on their screens again soon, let's look at what the women have been up to since the cameras stopped rolling.</p><h2 id=did-kary-brittingham-divorce-her-husband-after-the-real-housewives-of-dallas-was-canceled><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Did Kary Brittingham Divorce Her Husband After The Real Housewives Of Dallas Was Canceled?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The status of Kary Brittingham's relationship with her husband Eduardo was up-in-the-air for the entirety of season five. Kary was afraid to admit she was unhappy in her relationship. What she was even more fearful of was the financial insecurity that awaited her after divorcing her husband. She can be seen drinking excessively throughout the show's last season, with sources telling Us Weekly that's how the star began coping with the demise of the relationship. Fans felt <a href=#>her drinking brought out a dark side of her</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Real Housewives Of Dallas' What Is Cast Member Kary Brittingham's Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>Kary announced the couple's divorce on Instagram hours before the airing of season five's lackluster reunion.

She posts funny reels on Instagram weekly and engages with her fans. According to her Instagram, she's still working as an anesthesiologist, along with running her own candle line and being a full-time mom to twins.

While the truth to that statement can't be measured, Leanne was a fan-favorite, despite how polarizing of a figure she could be.</p><p>Since leaving the show, Leanne has focused on her career outside reality tv. She began acting again and was a featured model in numerous high-level publications, such as ReStyled Magazine. In an interview with DailyMailUK, the star said she didn't realize how much she needed to leave the show until she did. She compared it to being in an abusive relationship, noting she didn't know how happy she could be without it until the show was gone.</p><p>Leanne still lives in Dallas with her husband, Rich Emberlin.
