But&nbsp;after the film? She truly became famous; the role was hard-hitting, and critics were impressed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though she clearly didn't listen to anyone who told her she couldn't become a successful actress, Gabourey has confirmed there've been plenty of detractors throughout her decade-plus in Hollywood.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gabourey Sidibe Catches Heat For Announcing Engagement To White Man</a></span></p><p>In fact, Joan Cusack was one of the first big-wigs to tell Gabourey that Hollywood didn't have a place for her. As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Spy</a> explained, before she became well-known from her first movie, she ran into Joan Cusack at "some industry party."</p><p>Sidibe, answering the question of what celebrity was she disappointed by upon meeting them, said that though Joan Cusack is her "favourite favourite," the famous lady's words weren't the sweetest.</p><p>Gabourey maintained that "it's not in a mean way, because I know that she meant well," but that Joan straight-up told her to stop acting. She said that Joan asked if she was an actress, and when Gabourey said that she was, Joan's response was crushing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joan apparently said 'Oh honey, you should really quit the business, it's so image-conscious.' With her long list of experience in Hollywood, including time spent doing everything from a small role in 'Sixteen Candles' to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">voicing a character on 'Toy Story'</a> to acting in&nbsp;award-winning pieces like 'Shameless,' some would have taken Joan's advice to heart.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Eighties Stars We (Almost) Forgot About And Where They Are Now</a></span></p><p>As fans know now, Joan's comments — however well-meaning — may have stung at first, but they clearly didn't stop Sidibe from pursuing her dreams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After 'Precious,' Gabourey had a few roles in films, netted a role on 'The Big C' that lasted three years, acted in 'Difficult People' for two years, and then enjoyed a recurring role on 'American Horror Story' (and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the cast of&nbsp;the show has plenty to say about working on the series</a>). She&nbsp;also acted in 'Empire' for a five-year run, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a> highlights.</p><p>In short, Joan may have had Gabourey's feelings in mind, but she may have underestimated the actress's actual acting ability. Especially given Gabourey's recent performance in 'Antebellum.'</p><p>Though fans may not have seen Gabourey in the headlines much recently (apart from backlash over her engagement), she's still working a ton in Hollywood. In addition to her long resume on IMDb, Gabourey is also due to voice act in an upcoming CBS show, 'The Harper House.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gabourey has also won an impressively long list of awards — tons of them for 'Precious,' of course. But also for her work on 'Seven Psychopaths,' 'The Big C,' and 'American Horror Story: Coven.'</p><p>And for fans who can't get enough of Sidibe and want to hear her story in her own words, she's also written a memoir. It's called 'This Is Just My Face: Try Not to Stare.' and came out in 2017. Critics call it "wise, complex, smart, funny" and it sounds just like Gabourey Sidibe herself.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Horror Story: Ages, Heights and Relationship Statuses Of The Main Cast</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdn7yiuoycrKyZk6B6tbvLnWSgmZKkwrOx2GaqopyZl7JuvdSiq2aZk6m2r7OO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-joan-cusack-once-told-gabourey-sidibe-she-should-quit-acting.html&text=Why%20Joan%20Cusack%20Once%20Told%20Gabourey%20Sidibe%20She%20Should%20Quit%20Acting&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-joan-cusack-once-told-gabourey-sidibe-she-should-quit-acting.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-joan-cusack-once-told-gabourey-sidibe-she-should-quit-acting.html&title=Why%20Joan%20Cusack%20Once%20Told%20Gabourey%20Sidibe%20She%20Should%20Quit%20Acting" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-joan-cusack-once-told-gabourey-sidibe-she-should-quit-acting.html&title=Why%20Joan%20Cusack%20Once%20Told%20Gabourey%20Sidibe%20She%20Should%20Quit%20Acting" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-joan-cusack-once-told-gabourey-sidibe-she-should-quit-acting.html&title=Why%20Joan%20Cusack%20Once%20Told%20Gabourey%20Sidibe%20She%20Should%20Quit%20Acting" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-joan-cusack-once-told-gabourey-sidibe-she-should-quit-acting.html&description=Why%20Joan%20Cusack%20Once%20Told%20Gabourey%20Sidibe%20She%20Should%20Quit%20Acting" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./youtuber-moriah-elizabeth-s-daughter-s-name-revealed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Youtuber Moriah Elizabeths Daughters Name Revealed">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-timothy-b-schmit-twitter-hoax-and-his-health-update-in-2022.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened To Timothy B Schmit?
