But now that the hubbub has died down, let's take a look at what could have happened to his face, and why fans were wrong to freak out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Zac Efron's 'New Face' Sparks Debate On Male Beauty Standards</a></span></p><p><strong>Updated on March 2, 2022: </strong>As it turns out, a lot of the "drama" about Zac Efron's changing face was really just the result of one awkward video. While Zac Efron's appearance has changed over the years – as everyone's does – he is clearly not the victim of a botched plastic surgery procedure or a bad Botox job. Funnily enough, however, Zac Efron has filmed a couple of different projects recently that involved changing his face with makeup and prosthetics. He starred in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an AT&T Super Bowl commercial</a> in 2022 in which he played two different characters.</p><p>One looked like the regular Zac Efron we know and love, while for the other character he was seemingly wearing facial prosthetics, a lot of makeup, and a huge beard. He also starred in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a survival film called </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gold</a>, in which his poor face looks injured beyond belief, thanks to the great work of a talented makeup team.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-though-zac-efron-had-botox>Fans Though Zac Efron Had Botox</h2><p>When Zac appeared on camera for a virtual Earth Day event, fans were totally distracted by his face. Some suggested he had an "altered jawline" and enhanced lips, and suspected he'd had, at the very least, some Botox done.</p><p>It's true that he looked a bit puffy or possibly swollen, but of course, camera angles, makeup, and poor lighting also could've contributed to the drastically different look of everyone's favorite Hollywood hunk.</p><p>There were plenty of theories swirling around, both from fans and people who specialize in surgical procedures, but Zac didn't confirm or deny any of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-surgeon-said-oral-surgery-was-to-blame-for-zac-efron-39-s-changing-face>A Surgeon Said Oral Surgery Was To Blame For Zac Efron's Changing Face</h2><p>When fans first noticed Zac Efron's 'new face,' one plastic surgeon decided to comment. Dr. Youn's explanation was that <a href=#>oral surgery was a possibility</a>. He suggested that Zac Efron's face might have been swollen due to having his wisdom teeth taken out or some other kind of intensive dental surgery.</p><p>Fans, however, weren't happy about the doctor's comments. In fact, many accused him of trying to capitalize on Zac's popularity to gain attention. Fans also pointed out there's one other possible explanation for Zac's changing face that no one seems to want to talk about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-zac-efron-have-plastic-surgery>Did Zac Efron Have Plastic Surgery?</h2><p>It is, of course, possible that Zac Efron really did have plastic surgery. However, a close friend of his stated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zac had not</a>, and Efron himself hasn't admitted to anything. Plenty of celebs have alterations done to their faces and bodies, so if Zac chose the same, he wouldn't be alone in the decision.</p><p>Yet there are some troubling factors involved if Efron did opt for surgery; some wonder <a href=#>whether he's experienced body image issues</a>. He admitted that getting ripped for Baywatch <a href=#>wasn't easy nor enjoyable</a>, but also that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he had a whole lot of help</a> (personal trainers, nutritionists, chefs) to get that shaped up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even if he has felt insecure about his body, it seems highly unlikely, given all the effort that's gone into not just shaping his physique but keeping him healthy, that Zac would decide to completely change his face with plastic surgery.</p><h2 id=why-does-zac-efron-look-different-now>Why Does Zac Efron Look Different Now?</h2><p>It is true that although Zac Efron's face seems less 'puffy' in recent photos, his appearance is still different from that of a year or more ago. Looking through his Instagram photos, it's clear that over time, he's changed.</p><p>However, it's hard to pinpoint a specific time when his face suddenly changed shape. Not only does Zac often share throwback photos, but he's also shared images and videos from films he's worked on. However, most of the behind-the-scenes snapshots are a bit dated by now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Zac Efron & Other Celebrities Who Opened Up About Their Near-Death Experiences</a></span></p><p>This means it's hard to arrange Efron's photos into a true timeline, which web sleuths are probably wont to do to determine exactly when his facial features started changing. Joke's on them, though; when he's not sharing out-of-timeline pics, Zac also grows – and then shaves off – a beard from time to time.</p><p>Recently, he donned facial hair for Down to Earth with Zac Efron, whereas in the mini-films he's been working on with Jessica Alba, Efron is clean-shaven. Might he be hiding something, or might he simply be living his life and adjusting his appearance per role as he sees fit?</p><h2 id=a-simple-explanation-for-zac-efron-39-s-changing-face>A Simple Explanation For Zac Efron's Changing Face</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though fans can sleuth through Zac's Instagram photos and recent projects all day to chart his changing face, they might be reading way too much into the whole thing.</p><p>The fans who came to Zac Efron's defense against Dr. Youn's dental surgery assumption and critics' cruel memes about the actor have one simple explanation for why Zac looks different these days: age.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is Why Fans Say Zac Efron Is 'One Of Them'</a></span></p><p>Zac turned 34 in October 2021, so he's not the same fresh-faced teen he was in 2006 when High School Musical came out. While 34 is by no means old, Zac Efron's face had to grow up with the rest of his body, and he's not 18 anymore.</p><p>As Zac's peers already know, entering one's thirties can mean many changes, even for someone who once graced the beaches of Baywatch with his six-pack gleaming in the sun. Bodies change, including faces, and while it's entirely possible Zac had some kind of trauma to his face at one point, his looks have also changed naturally over time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans just need to adjust to the current-era Zac Efron and his more mature face.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here's Why Fans Think Zac Efron Looks Taller Than He Really Is</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr%2BmrculsGagkaW9prrEnWSzmZNisqe%2Bzqdkn5mTmnw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-really-happened-to-zac-efron-s-face.html&text=What%20Really%20Happened%20To%20Zac%20Efron%27s%20Face%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-really-happened-to-zac-efron-s-face.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-really-happened-to-zac-efron-s-face.html&title=What%20Really%20Happened%20To%20Zac%20Efron%27s%20Face%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-really-happened-to-zac-efron-s-face.html&title=What%20Really%20Happened%20To%20Zac%20Efron%27s%20Face%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-really-happened-to-zac-efron-s-face.html&title=What%20Really%20Happened%20To%20Zac%20Efron%27s%20Face%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-really-happened-to-zac-efron-s-face.html&description=What%20Really%20Happened%20To%20Zac%20Efron%27s%20Face%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-johnny-manziel-girlfriend-now-2022-more-about-his-divorce-with-wife-bre-tiesi-explored.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Johnny Manziel Girlfriend Now 2022?
