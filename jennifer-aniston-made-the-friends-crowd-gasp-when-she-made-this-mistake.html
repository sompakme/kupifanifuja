During its ten seasons, we've seen so many different bloopers, of scenes going completely wrong.</p><p>We'll revisit some of the best, along with featuring a certain moment that <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a></strong> likely regrets.</p><h2 id=39-friends-39-continues-to-be-a-tv-powerhouse-all-these-years-later>'Friends' Continues To Be A TV Powerhouse All These Years Later</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After shooting ten seasons, 'Friends' came to an end way back in 2004. For hardcore fans, the show never really came to an end, as reruns are played on a loop. Without a doubt, this will continue to be the case for generations to come, as the show is cash-cow, continuing to bring in millions thanks to merchandise and of course, the syndication rights.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>'Friends': The Saddest Moment On The Show, According To Fans</a></span></p><p>So how is 'Friends' still such a juggernaut all these years later? Well, according to the New York Times, a major reason is <a href=#>due to how easy the show is to watch, for anyone.</a></p><p>"Friends was easy TV at an elite level. So many jokes, so much body comedy, so many surprises and awwws, and squeals of live-studio audience excitement. Hairdressers were doing — and not infrequently botching — the Rachel."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Coffee shops became people’s second homes. Tens of millions of Americans watched all of that writing and directing and acting, all of that seemingly effortless effort, for all 10 of its years. That work and a country’s devotion to it feels like proof of a golden age of something."</p><p>Not only was the show great, but the cast's closeness was on full display during the many bloopers throughout its 10 seasons.</p><p>Along with binging on the show, fans also have many bloopers to watch as well.</p><h2 id=fans-can-39-t-get-enough-of-the-iconic-bloopers-that-spanned-a-decade>Fans Can't Get Enough Of The Iconic Bloopers That Spanned A Decade</h2><p>We've seen so many classic 'Friends' bloopers from the past, it is truly impossible to pick one as the absolute best. We've seen the cast laugh so hard during takes but at the same time, we've also seen frustration, like in season 8 when Chandler was trying to utter his incredibly difficult line during 'Bamboozled', only for Joey, aka Matt LeBlanc to completely flub his line right after.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>‘Friends’: Jennifer Aniston Shares Underrated Deleted Scene Blooper</a></span></p><p>For the most part, fans recall the bloopers of the cast completely breaking, like when Ross kept yelling "pivot," alongside Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston - it took the cast several takes to finally get through that one.</p><p>Or in the earlier seasons, when poor Matt LeBlanc is walking into the coffee house and misses a step, only to fall flat on his face. Things would only get worse for the actor in the next take, as he checked and visibly looked at the step while walking in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And of course, during the fourth take, he was intercepted by Chandler when he was trying to sit on the chair. The moment was accompanied by major laughter by both the studio audience and those working behind the scenes.</p><h2 id=the-live-audience-gasped-when-jennifer-aniston-said-quot-chandler-39-s-show-quot-instead-of-quot-joey-39-s-show-quot>The Live Audience Gasped When Jennifer Aniston Said, "Chandler's Show" Instead Of "Joey's Show"</h2><p>This blooper is of a different variety. In truth, the audience gasped and those behind the scenes weren't happy with Jennifer Aniston's line flub. You can watch the moment yourself on the video below, right around the 3:50 mark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rachel says, "Chandler hunny, I'm so sorry. Okay, can we watch Chandler's show now please?" Aniston immediately realizes she made a mistake screaming out, "oh." Chandler also looks on in disbelief while the crowd gasped.</p><p>Turns out that those behind the scenes weren't all that thrilled either, as Aniston then states, "oh don't give me that look."</p><p>Of course, Matthew Perry decided to have some fun with the mistake as in the next take, he would look at Phoebe and say, "because sometimes Ross," which was met with a huge laugh from the audience, along with Aniston.</p><p>It was a rare mistake from Aniston and one that the fans and crew behind the scenes didn't let slide.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Was 'Friends' Just A Ripoff Of 'Living Single'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoyapaKrpKS7brLRopynnKNir627zqmcq2WTp7y4sIygmKyoXaK2tMDApJxo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjennifer-aniston-made-the-friends-crowd-gasp-when-she-made-this-mistake.html&text=Jennifer%20Aniston%20Made%20The%20%27Friends%27%20Crowd%20Gasp%20When%20She%20Made%20This%20Mistake%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjennifer-aniston-made-the-friends-crowd-gasp-when-she-made-this-mistake.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjennifer-aniston-made-the-friends-crowd-gasp-when-she-made-this-mistake.html&title=Jennifer%20Aniston%20Made%20The%20%27Friends%27%20Crowd%20Gasp%20When%20She%20Made%20This%20Mistake%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjennifer-aniston-made-the-friends-crowd-gasp-when-she-made-this-mistake.html&title=Jennifer%20Aniston%20Made%20The%20%27Friends%27%20Crowd%20Gasp%20When%20She%20Made%20This%20Mistake%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjennifer-aniston-made-the-friends-crowd-gasp-when-she-made-this-mistake.html&title=Jennifer%20Aniston%20Made%20The%20%27Friends%27%20Crowd%20Gasp%20When%20She%20Made%20This%20Mistake%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjennifer-aniston-made-the-friends-crowd-gasp-when-she-made-this-mistake.html&description=Jennifer%20Aniston%20Made%20The%20%27Friends%27%20Crowd%20Gasp%20When%20She%20Made%20This%20Mistake%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./john-fogerty-net-worth-how-much-is-john-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Fogerty Net Worth  How Much is John Worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./inside-ryan-gosling-s-million-dollar-fortune.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Inside Ryan Gosling's Million-Dollar Fortune">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
