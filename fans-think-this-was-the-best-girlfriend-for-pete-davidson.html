However, fans think that his romance with Phoebe Dynevor was one of the most memorable ones. Let's take a look at their relationship and how Pete Davidson conquered her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pete Davidson and Bridgerton star Phoebe Dynevor were sparking relationship rumors after they popped up in each other's hometowns. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, the two were "spending time together" as Pete flew to Phoebe's hometown in Greater Manchester shortly after sharing photos from her time in New York back in February.</p><p>While they were in the UK in March, Pete and Phoebe were reportedly seen holding hands and hugging while they were out and about. Pete even took part in Bridgerton themed SNL sketch where he acted alongside Phoebe's co-star Regé-Jean Page.</p><h2 id=dating-his-celebrity-crush>Dating His Celebrity Crush</h2><p>The comedian was asked who his celebrity crush is during a Zoom Q&A with students of Marquette University. Fans thought his answer was adorable, and some even said they could feel him blushing through the screen. He said, "I'm with my celebrity crush." His smile really said it all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pete specifically didn't name Phoebe, and he added that he couldn't go into further detail about their relationship. But even this little moment showed how giddy he was about the fact he's with his celebrity crush.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Pete Davidson May Just Be One Of Hollywood's Biggest Bad Boys</a></span></p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, these two were going strong despite being long-distance. A source told the outlet, "Pete and Phoebe are still going strong despite not being able to physically spend time together."</p><p>The insider added that they were taking things slow and keeping in touch over text and FaceTime when they couldn't be together due to work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans have had a lot to say about their relationship on social media. One person wrote, "Pete Davidson is dating Phoebe Dynevor of Bridgerton? So cute! I love unlikely couples!" Another chimed in, saying, "idk who I'm more jealous of, Phoebe Dynevor or Pete Davidson?"</p><p>One person joked that "Phoebe Dynevor went from Duke of Hastings to the King of Staten Island." Fans were excited that they seemed so happy. However, things quickly came to an end.</p><h2 id=unexpected-breakup>Unexpected Breakup</h2><p>Recently, they were spotted packing on the PDA at Wimbledon, where they kissed and cuddled each other while watching the tennis tournament.</p><p>Based on how happy they looked in the pics taken by paparazzi and things like Pete saying he was dating his celebrity crush, it seemed to fans things were going super well for these two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like it was as perfect as it seemed. The Sun and Page Six have both reported that <a href=#>Pete and Phoebe have officially split after five months together</a>.</p><h2 id=busy-schedules>Busy Schedules</h2><p>According to the outlets, <a href=#>they apparently split because of the distance between</a> them and their busy schedules. As fans know, Pete is based in New York, and Phoebe lives in England. A source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, "Their mates think they make a great couple, but the distance has made it completely unworkable. They had fun and will remain close, but unless something drastic changes, their relationship won't recover."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The insider continued revealing that, "They both really care for each other. But the distance has put a strain on them." They also added that COVID has also played a role in their long-distance relationship not working out, saying that, "Obviously all the travel restrictions because of the pandemic have not helped. People can't just jump on planes and jet around the world when they want to. It has made everything more difficult."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Are Obsessed With Kaley Cuoco and Pete Davidson Goofing Around On The Set Of 'Meet Cute'</a></span></p><p>On top of the distance, the source discussed how Phoebe has had back-to-back filming dates with Bridgerton in the UK, and Pete has just started working on a new film, Meet Cute, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaley Cuoco</a>.</p><p>Apparently, they haven't seen each other since last month, and while at one point the source said they were both totally committed, it's now officially fizzled out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans think Phoebe was the best girlfriend for Pete because, despite the distance, she always took great care of him. She could make him smile in a very special way. For this reason, is easy to tell that she was an adorable and caring girlfriend. If it wasn't for their busy schedules, things could have worked out.</p><h2 id=linked-to-kaley-cuoco>Linked to Kaley Cuoco</h2><p>Fans may recall when Kaley Cuoco and her now ex-husband, Karl Cook, revealed they were splitting after three years of marriage just a couple of weeks ago. Many were quick to chime in with just how heartbroken and shocked they were to hear the news.</p><p><a href=#>Pete and Kaley were spotted cozying up</a> while shooting a scene for their upcoming movie.
